</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span> STOUT gentleman of middle age and
two boys were sitting in the public room
of a modest inn in Melbourne. The
gentleman was known to the public as
Professor Hemmenway, who announced
himself on the programme of his entertainment as
“The Magician of Madagascar,” though he freely
confessed to his confidential friends that he had
never seen the island of that name.</p>

<p>The two boys were Harry Vane and Jack
Pendleton, boys of sixteen. One had come to
Australia as assistant to the professor, and had
been accustomed to sing one or two popular songs
at the magical entertainments which he gave,
besides rendering himself generally useful. Jack
Pendleton was a young sailor, who had resolved
to try his fortune in the new country, either at
the mines or in any other employment offering
fair compensation, before resuming his profession.
Harry and the professor had been passengers on
board Jack’s ship, and the two boys had struck
up an enduring friendship. The ship had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
wrecked, and they had spent some weeks together
on an uninhabited island, from which they were
finally rescued. It had been the professor’s intention
to give a series of performances in Melbourne
and other parts of Australia, but the
unexpected delay had led him to change his plans,
and he now proposed to return home at once.
Harry Vane, however, having no near family ties,
for he was an orphan, felt inclined to stay with
Jack, and try his fortune for a time in the New
World, which appealed strongly to his imagination
and youthful love of adventure. The day had
arrived for the professor’s departure, and he and
the two boys were waiting for the lighter to take
him down the Yarra Yarra River to the point of
embarkation, eight miles distant.</p>

<p>“Harry,” said the professor kindly, “I don’t like
to leave you here. You are only sixteen, and I feel
that it is a great undertaking for you to attempt
to make a living so many thousand miles from your
native land. I shall feel anxious about you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel anxious about myself, professor,” said
Harry, with the confidence natural to youth. “I am
young and strong, and I mean to succeed.”</p>

<p>“But suppose you fall sick?”</p>

<p>“Then Jack will look out for me.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure of that, Harry,” said the young
sailor, with a glance of affection at Harry.</p>

<p>“You might both fall sick.”</p>

<p>“Is it best to borrow trouble?” said Harry, smiling.
“I think we shall come out all right. But I am sorry
you won’t stay with us, professor.”</p>

<p>Professor Hemmenway shook his head.</p>

<p>“I am three times your age, Harry,” he said, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
am not as hopeful or sanguine as you. Besides, I
have a wife and children at home who are already
very anxious at my long silence; I did indeed mean
to make a professional tour of Australia, but the
shipwreck and those lonely weeks on the island
changed my plans. I have a competence already,
and can make an income at home twice as large as
my expenses. Why should I incur any risks?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but you are right, professor, but
Jack and I are not so fortunate. Neither of us has
a competence, and our prospects are probably better
here than at home.”</p>

<p>“Remember, Harry, that if you return I shall be
glad to continue your engagement and will even
increase your salary.”</p>

<p>Jack Pendleton fixed his eyes anxiously on Harry’s
face. He feared that he would yield to the professor’s
persuasion and leave him, but his anxiety was soon
removed.</p>

<p>“Thank you, professor,” said Harry, “but I don’t
want to leave Jack. If I return in bad luck, I may look
you up and see whether the offer still holds good.”</p>

<p>“Do so. You will always find a friend in me.
But that reminds me, Harry, of an important consideration.
If you are to remain here, you will want
some money.”</p>

<p>“I have twelve pounds which I have saved up in
your service.”</p>

<p>“And how much have you, Jack?”</p>

<p>The young sailor coloured, and looked a little
uneasy.</p>

<p>“I have only two pounds,” he answered.</p>

<p>“That is, we have fourteen pounds between us,
Jack,” said Harry promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“That is too little,” said the professor, shaking his
head. “You must let me be your banker.”</p>

<p>“On one condition, professor, with thanks for your
kindness.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“A gentleman at home, Mr. Thomas Conway, has
charge of fifty pounds belonging to me. I was
fortunate enough to save a railway train from destruction,
and this is the money the passengers
raised for me. I will give you an order on him
for the amount of your loan.”</p>

<p>“That is unnecessary, Harry; I am willing to wait
till you return.”</p>

<p>“Something might happen to me, professor, and I
shall feel more comfortable to think that my debts
are paid.”</p>

<p>“Have your own way, then, Harry. Shall I give
you the whole amount?”</p>

<p>“No, professor, I am afraid it would make me less
enterprising.”</p>

<p>“How much shall it be?”</p>

<p>“Jack and I have fourteen pounds between us.
Twenty more ought to be sufficient.”</p>

<p>“As you please, Harry; but if you get into trouble,
promise to communicate with me, and send for
assistance.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir.”</p>

<p>At this moment a carriage drew up in front of
the inn.</p>

<p>“It is the carriage I ordered to take me to the
lighter,” said the professor. “You and Jack must
go with me to the ship and see the last of me.”</p>

<p>“With great pleasure, sir. Come along, Jack.”</p>

<p>The driver put the professor’s trunk on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
carriage, and they set out. It was a new trunk,
bought in Melbourne, for the professor’s trunk and
clothing had been lost at the time of the shipwreck.
His first care had been to get a complete
outfit in Melbourne, and he was now as well provided
as when he left home.</p>

<p>The two boys found the trip down the river a
pleasant one. The trip by land would have been
considerably shorter, but the professor preferred the
river. The distance to the mouth is nine miles.
The city of Melbourne is situated chiefly on the
north bank, and is a handsomely built and prosperous
town. The country bordering the river is
not particularly inviting, but it was new, and the
two boys regarded it with interest. The soil was
barren and sandy, and the trees, which were numerous,
were eucalyptus or gum trees, which do not
require a rich soil, but grow with great rapidity on
sterile soil.</p>

<p>Harry could not help feeling sad as he bade farewell
to his good friend the professor.</p>

<p>“I have only you now, Jack,” he said. “I don’t
know what lies before us, but we must stick fast to
each other in sunshine and in storm.”</p>

<p>Jack’s only answer was to seize Harry’s hand and
press it warmly. Nothing more was needed.</p>

<p>The two boys returned to the Crown Hotel in
time for dinner, of which they partook with the zest
to be expected of boys thoroughly healthy. When
the meal was over they repaired to the public room.</p>

<p>“Now, Jack,” said Harry, “it is necessary for us to
settle on our plans.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Have you anything to propose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“No, Harry, you are smarter than I am, and I
leave it to you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Jack, for your confidence, but we
are on a par here. Neither of us knows much
about Australia. We have a great deal to learn.”</p>

<p>“Then you had better decide for us both.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I accept the responsibility, but I prefer
to talk over my plans with you. First of all, then,
shall we stay in Melbourne, or strike for the mines?”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Harry, but I would prefer the
mines.”</p>

<p>“I feel that way myself, and for that reason I
have been making some inquiries. There are three
principal localities—Ballarat, Bendigo, and Ovens.
We might try one of the three, and if we don’t
have good luck make our way to another.”</p>

<p>“Which shall we try first?”</p>

<p>“I have thought of Bendigo. I hear of one
party that cleared two thousand pounds out of
one hole.”</p>

<p>“How much is that?” asked Jack, who was not
very well acquainted with any but United States
currency.</p>

<p>“It is equal to ten thousand dollars,” answered
Harry.</p>

<p>“That’s a big pile of money,” said Jack, his eyes
sparkling.</p>

<p>“True, but we mustn’t expect to be so fortunate.
It isn’t everybody who succeeds as well as that.”</p>

<p>“I should be satisfied with a thousand, Harry.”</p>

<p>“And what would you do with it, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Convey it home to my mother, Harry. But I
would fix it so that my stepfather couldn’t get hold
of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“You are a good boy, Jack, for thinking so much
of your mother. I wish I had a mother to provide
for,” and Harry Vane looked sober.</p>

<p>“Do you know how far off Bendigo is, Harry?”</p>

<p>“About a hundred miles. That is, it is seventy-five
miles to Mount Alexander, and the mines are
twenty-five miles to the north of that.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take us long to travel a hundred miles,”
said Jack hopefully.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, it will be a long and difficult
journey, as far as I can find out. The country is
full of bogs, swamps, and moist land.”</p>

<p>“Then we can’t walk?”</p>

<p>“No; the custom is to charter a cart, drawn by
oxen, which will give a chance to carry a stock of
provisions. The roads are not very well marked,
and are often impassable.”</p>

<p>This description rather discouraged Jack, who
was more used to the sea and its dangers than to
land travel.</p>

<p>“I wish we could go by water,” he said.</p>

<p>“So do I, Jack, but unfortunately Bendigo happens
to be inland. However, you’ve got good stout legs,
and can get along as well as the thousands that do
go. Besides, it will give us a fine chance to see
the country.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” said Jack doubtfully, for he had very
little of the traveller’s curiosity that prompts so
many to visit strange lands.</p>

<p>“There’s another difficulty besides the mud,” continued
Harry thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“The bushrangers.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Haven’t you heard of them?” asked Harry in
surprise.</p>

<p>“I heard two men speaking of them last night,
but I didn’t take much notice.”</p>

<p>“They are highwaymen—robbers, who wander
about and attack parties of miners and travellers,
and unless successfully resisted, strip them of all
their property.”</p>

<p>“Are we likely to meet them?” said Jack eagerly.</p>

<p>“I hope not; but we stand a chance of doing so.”</p>

<p>“When are we going to start?” asked Jack with
alacrity.</p>

<p>“Do you want to meet these gentlemen, Jack?”
inquired Harry with a smile.</p>

<p>“There’ll be some fun about it,” responded Jack.</p>

<p>Harry shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’ll be much fun about being
robbed,” he said. “I would rather they would give
us a wide berth, for my part.”</p>

<p>Jack did not answer, but from that time he was
eager to set out for the mines. The hint of danger
invested the journey with a charm it had not hitherto
possessed in his eyes.</p>

<p>While the boys were conversing, a tall man, with
heavy black whiskers and wearing a rough suit and
a slouch hat, appeared to listen attentively. At this
point he rose from his seat, and lounged over to where
Harry and Jack were seated.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen,” he said, “do I understand
that you are thinking of going to the mines?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Harry, surveying his inquirer
with some attention.</p>

<p>“And you talk of going to Bendigo?”</p>

<p>“Yes; do you know anything about the place?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“I ought to. I only came from there last month.”</p>

<p>“What luck did you have there, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair. I brought back about a hundred and
fifty pounds in gold-dust.”</p>

<p>“And how long were you there?”</p>

<p>“Four weeks.”</p>

<p>“That is pretty good pay for the time.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, especially as I made little or nothing
the first three weeks. I struck it rich the last week.”</p>

<p>“What do you say to that, Jack?” said Harry,
turning to his companion.</p>

<p>“That pays better than being a sailor,” answered
Jack, smiling.</p>

<p>“I should say it did.”</p>

<p>“When do you expect to start?” asked the
stranger.</p>

<p>“As soon as we can get ready,” Harry replied.</p>

<p>“You are right there. Have you got money?”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Harry, rather suspiciously.</p>

<p>“It will cost something for an outfit.”</p>

<p>“Yes; we have a moderate sum with us.”</p>

<p>“That is well,” said the stranger approvingly. “Do
you know,” he continued meditatively, “I have a
great mind to go with you?”</p>

<p>“Then you are not satisfied with your pile?” said
Harry.</p>

<p>“There’s very little left of it,” said their new
acquaintance.</p>

<p>“You haven’t spent a hundred and fifty pounds in
a month?” said Harry, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Pretty much. I may have twenty pounds left.”</p>

<p>“You must have been living high, then.”</p>

<p>“No. I have lived plainly, but the faro table has
taken most of it. I’m so near broke that I may as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
well go back to the mines for a fresh supply before
my money is all gone.”</p>

<p>“We shall be glad of your company, sir.”</p>

<p>“My name is Fletcher—Dick Fletcher my friends
call me.”</p>

<p>“I am Harry Vane, and my friend is Jack
Pendleton.”</p>

<p>“We will drink to our better acquaintance. Here,
John,” addressing the bar-keeper, “three glasses of
ale here.”</p>

<p>“If you won’t mind, Jack and I will take
lemonade.”</p>

<p>Fletcher stared at them in amazement.</p>

<p>“You don’t drink ale?” he said.</p>

<p>“We belong to the temperance society,” said
Harry, smiling.</p>

<p>“You won’t keep that up long at the mines,”
said Fletcher, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>Harry did not reply, but quietly resolved that
he would disprove that statement.</p>

<small>A TIMELY RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_018.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="O">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">O</span>NE circumstance led Harry to hurry his
intended departure. He found to his
dismay that the hotel charge for their
very plain accommodations was a pound
a day for each of them. But Melbourne
was full of strangers, drawn thither by flaming
accounts of the richness of the mines and the bright
prospects of acquiring sudden fortunes, and war
prices were prevalent everywhere.</p>

<p>“A pound a day!” exclaimed Jack in open-eyed
amazement. “Do they take us for millionaires?”</p>

<p>“I began to think they were imposing upon us,”
said Harry, “till I made inquiries elsewhere. I find
a pound a day is about the usual tariff for such accommodations
as we have.”</p>

<p>“But we have only a small bedroom, and the meals
are very common.”</p>

<p>“That is true, but it seems to make no difference.”</p>

<p>“Our money will soon be gone at that rate,” said
Jack soberly. “Mine is already gone.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t, Jack. We are going to share and
share alike, you know.”</p>

<p>“But that is imposing on you, Harry,” protested
the young sailor earnestly.</p>

<p>“Let me judge of that, Jack; I’d a good deal rather
have your company and half of the money than be
alone and have the whole.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Thank you, Harry. You are a true friend. I
can’t do much for you, but I’ll do what I can.”</p>

<p>“If I had known of the high prices, I would have
drawn more money from the professor,” continued
Harry. “However, I can make this do. But I
want to start to-morrow, if possible. We shall then
be owing four days’ board each, and that will make
eight pounds.”</p>

<p>At this point Fletcher joined them.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said he nonchalantly, “I want to
ask a little favour.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Harry unsuspiciously.</p>

<p>“I am rather short of money. Can you lend me
five pounds?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to refuse, Mr. Fletcher,” he said,
“but Jack and I are ourselves very poorly provided
with money, and just before you came in we were
considering how we could manage to pay for the
necessary outfit.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got five pounds?” asked Fletcher
quickly.</p>

<p>“Of course we have, or we should be unable to get
to the mines.”</p>

<p>“Then I think you might oblige me,” he continued,
looking very much displeased.</p>

<p>“I am the best judge of my circumstances,” said
Harry shortly.</p>

<p>Fletcher looked hard at him, and saw that the boy
he had to deal with had a mind of his own, and was
not to be imposed upon easily. Still he made a
further effort.</p>

<p>“Then I think,” he said coldly, “I shall not be
able to assist you in your preparations.”</p>

<p>“Just as you please,” answered Harry promptly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
“As you volunteered, I accepted your proposal. Now
I will act for myself. I have heard of a party about
to start, and I will arrange to join it.”</p>

<p>Fletcher felt that he was outgeneralled. He did
not mean to let Harry and Jack slip through his
fingers, for he had an idea, notwithstanding Harry’s
disclaimer, that he had a large sum of money, and
thought he would be a good party to hang on to.
He saw that he had made a false move, and hastened
to repair it.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said, assuming a hearty tone;
“I was hasty, and I apologise. You are right, and
I like you too well to cut up rough, just because you
can’t do me a favour. There, take my hand, and we
will make it all up.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” answered Harry, as he accepted
the proffered hand, and Jack followed his example.
Nevertheless, Fletcher’s demand had produced an
unpleasant effect upon him. The coarse-grained
selfishness of the man had shown through his outward
varnish of good-fellowship, and he felt that
henceforth he must be on his guard.</p>

<p>“I may have to ask for some money, however,”
continued Fletcher, in an offhand manner, “for it
is necessary to buy supplies for our journey. You
know we shan’t be able to put up at hotels on our
way, but must furnish our own meals.”</p>

<p>“So I have heard,” answered Harry. “What is it
customary to take?”</p>

<p>“Well, it will be best to buy a bag of coffee, a sack
of flour, some ship biscuits, potatoes, and sugar. That
will do to start on, and we shall vary our diet by what
we are able to kill on the way.”</p>

<p>“What can we kill?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Well, kangaroo meat isn’t bad, and we can bring
down a few birds occasionally.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall need guns?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it will be well to have them.”</p>

<p>This was another expense upon which Harry had
not calculated. He began to think that he had been
very improvident. The professor would readily have
left him twenty pounds more, and as it would have
been repaid with his own money, he was sorry he
had not availed himself of it.</p>

<p>“How much do you think the supplies will cost?”
asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Well, you had better let me have ten pounds. I
think that will be sufficient.”</p>

<p>“For the whole or for our share?” asked Harry
pointedly.</p>

<p>“For your share,” answered Fletcher, after a pause.
“It seems to me you are very suspicious.”</p>

<p>Really he had intended to make the two boys
pay for the whole stock of provisions and save his
own purse, for he had in reality as much money
as they.</p>

<p>“I only wanted to understand clearly,” said Harry
quietly. “As we are in some sort partners, that is
fair, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” returned Fletcher, but he did not respond
with any alacrity. “I’m always fair and
aboveboard, I am. No man can say that Dick
Fletcher ever tried to get the best of him. Why, if
I was better fixed I wouldn’t let you two boys pay at
all. I’d shoulder the whole thing myself.”</p>

<p>“Your offer is a very kind one, Mr. Fletcher——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say Mr. Fletcher; call me Dick,” interrupted
their new acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“I will if you wish it, though as you are so much
older, it hardly seems proper. What I was going
to say was that Jack and myself are determined to
pay our share. We couldn’t accept any such favour
as you mention.”</p>

<p>“Now, if you let me have the ten pounds I’ll take
all the trouble off your hands, and have everything
ready for a start to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“I would prefer to go with you and help select
the articles.”</p>

<p>Fletcher looked disconcerted.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you think I ain’t capable——” he began.</p>

<p>“I think nothing of the kind, but I want to
learn as much as I can. I may have to do it alone
some time.”</p>

<p>It was well Harry adhered to his determination.
It saved him three pounds, and Fletcher was forced
to pay his share, as he had not intended to do.
While they were making purchases they were
accosted by a tall loose-jointed man, whom it was
easy to recognise as a Yankee.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to the mines, boys?” he asked in a strong
nasal tone.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>“So am I. I’d like to hook on to your party if
you ain’t no objections.”</p>

<p>For some reason Dick Fletcher did not appear to
relish the proposal.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we can accommodate you,” he said
abruptly.</p>

<p>“I think we can,” said Harry, who was beginning
to be distrustful of Fletcher, and felt safer in adding
another to the party. “There are but three of us,
and we shall be glad of your company.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Dick Fletcher looked angry, but did not venture to
oppose the plan further.</p>

<p>On the last evening spent in Melbourne the boys
decided to take a farewell walk about the city, not
knowing when it would again be their fortune to
see it. Neither Fletcher nor their new Yankee acquaintance
was at hand, and they started by themselves.
They did not confine themselves to the more
frequented streets, but followed wherever fancy led.</p>

<p>They had no thought of an adventure, but one
awaited them.</p>

<p>As they were turning the corner of a narrow street,
their attention was suddenly excited by a sharp cry
of blended surprise and fright.</p>

<p>“What is it, Jack?” asked Harry, grasping his
companion by the arm.</p>

<p>He did not need to await a reply, for by the indistinct
light he saw two men struggling a short
distance farther on. One appeared to be an old man,
with white hair, the other was a man of middle age.
Clearly it was a case of attempted robbery.</p>

<p>“Run, Jack, run!” said Harry, in excitement.
“Let us help the old man!”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” answered the young sailor briefly.</p>

<p>Harry had in his hand a heavy walking-stick—his
only weapon—but he did not stop to consider the
personal risk he was running. As he drew near, the
old man, whose feeble strength was quite unequal to
a conflict with a man so much younger, swayed and
fell backward. His assailant bent over him, and despite
his feeble resistance began to search his pockets,
at the same time indulging in savage threats. The
old man gave himself up for lost, but help was nearer
than he anticipated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>So occupied was the villain with his disgraceful
work that he did not hear the approaching footsteps.</p>

<p>His first intimation of them came in a sounding
blow over his shoulders, given by Harry’s stick, which
was laid on with a good will.</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet with an oath, and darted a
rapid glance at his two assailants. Then, much to the
surprise of Harry, he turned and ran rapidly away.
It was a piece of great good luck, Harry thought,
for he was not at all sure that he and Jack combined
would have been a match for the highwayman.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, sir?” asked Harry, bending over
the old man.</p>

<p>“Not seriously,” was the reply. “Will you kindly
help me up?”</p>

<p>With Jack’s help Harry got the old man on his
feet. He was a tall man, of splendid aspect, over sixty
years of age. He looked like a gentleman of wealth
and position.</p>

<p>“You have had a narrow escape, sir,” said our hero.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered the old man, “thanks to
your brave interference. It surprises me that my
brutal assailant should have run away from two
boys.”</p>

<p>“I am surprised also, sir. I feared we should have
a hard fight. I suppose his object was robbery.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he must have heard in some way that I had
a large sum of money about me. Thanks to you, it
is safe.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind accompanying me to my house?
This attack has made me timid.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, sir.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman lived perhaps a quarter of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
mile distant in a handsome house. He pressed the
boys to enter, and they did so. He questioned them
as to their plans, and then selecting two bank-notes,
urged the boys to accept them as a recognition of the
help they had given him at a critical moment. The
boys, however, declined positively to accept any compensation,
but expressed their satisfaction at having
been of service.</p>

<p>“At least,” said the old gentleman, “you must promise
to call on me when you return from the mines.
There is my card.”</p>

<p>“That we will do with pleasure, sir,” answered
Harry.</p>

<p>He looked at the card, and read the name of Henry
A. Woolson.</p>

<p>“Harry,” said Jack, as they resumed their walk,
“do you know that robber had a look like Fletcher?”</p>

<p>“So I thought, Jack, but I had only a glimpse, and
could not be sure. I wish he were not to be in our
party.”</p>

<p>“We must be on our guard; I don’t fancy him
much.”</p>

<p>When the boys saw Fletcher in the morning he appeared
as usual, and they were disposed to think they
were mistaken. Yet the lurking suspicion occurred
to them from time to time, and made them feel
uneasy.</p>

<p>The next day they set out on their journey, accompanied
by Dick Fletcher and Obed Stackpole.</p>

<small>STARTING FOR THE MINES</small></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">H</span>ARRY may be considered rash in his
immediate acceptance of his Yankee acquaintance
as a member of their party,
but there are some men who need no
letters of recommendation. Obed Stackpole
certainly was not a handsome man. He was tall,
lean, gaunt in figure, with a shambling walk, and
his skin was tough and leathery; but in spite of
all there was an honest, manly expression which
instantly inspired confidence. Both Harry and Jack
liked him, but Dick Fletcher seemed to regard him
with instinctive dislike.</p>

<p>“What made you accept that scarecrow into our
company?” he asked, when Stackpole had left them
to make his own arrangements for leaving the
city.</p>

<p>Harry smiled.</p>

<p>“He isn’t a handsome man,” he replied, “but I
think he will prove a valuable companion.”</p>

<p>“You took no notice of my objection to him,”
said Fletcher, frowning.</p>

<p>“Our company was too small,” returned Harry.
“From inquiry I find that parties seldom consist of
less than half-a-dozen.”</p>

<p>“I know all about that,” said Fletcher impatiently.
“You might have been guided by me.”</p>

<p>“I shall be to some extent,” answered Harry, “but
not implicitly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“I am going to have trouble with that boy,”
thought Fletcher. “Wait till we get on the road.”
Aloud he said: “If you had mentioned the matter
to me I would have found some one to go with us.
You had better tell this Yankee that we haven’t
room for him, and I will do it now.”</p>

<p>Fletcher’s persistence only aroused vague suspicions
in Harry’s breast. He felt glad that Stackpole
was neither a friend nor likely to prove a confederate
of Dick Fletcher, and was resolved to hold on to
him.</p>

<p>“I have invited him, and I won’t take back the
invitation,” he said.</p>

<p>“How old are you?” asked Fletcher abruptly.</p>

<p>“Sixteen.”</p>

<p>“I should think you were sixty by the tone you
assume,” said Fletcher with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Do I understand, Mr. Fletcher,” asked Harry
steadily, “that you claim to control our party?”</p>

<p>“Seeing that I am more than twice as old as you
are, I am the natural head of the expedition.”</p>

<p>“I cannot admit any such claim. If you are not
satisfied to be simply a member of the party, like
the rest of us, I shall not be offended if you back
out even now.”</p>

<p>This, however, did not suit Fletcher, and with a
forced laugh he answered, “You are a strange boy,
Vane. I don’t want to back out, as you term it. I
fancy we shall get along together.”</p>

<p>“I wish he had decided to leave us,” said Harry,
when the two boys were alone. “Somehow I distrust
him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like him myself,” said Jack, “but I don’t
see what harm he can do us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“Nor I, but I feel safer with this Yankee addition
to our party.”</p>

<p>About ten o’clock the next morning the little
party got off. It is needless to say that Obed
Stackpole contributed his full share of expense, and
more too, for he furnished the yoke of oxen that
were to draw the cart which conveyed their provisions
and other outfit.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to push in where I ain’t wanted,”
he said, “but I’m used to oxen, and if you want
me to, I’ll drive these critters, and you three can
foller along as you please.”</p>

<p>“That’ll suit me,” said Fletcher, with unusual
graciousness. “I’ve no doubt you understand the
business better than I do.”</p>

<p>“I ought to understand it,” said Stackpole. “I
was raised on a farm in New Hampshire, and used
to drive oxen when I wasn’t tall enough to see
over their backs. I never thought then that I’d be
drivin’ a team in Australy.”</p>

<p>“What led you to come out here, Mr. Stackpole?”
asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Well, a kinder rovin’ disposition, I guess. A
year ago I was in Californy, but things didn’t pan
out very well, so when I read accounts of the goldfields
out here, I jist dropped my pick and started,
and here I am.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you find any gold-dust in California?”
asked Fletcher, with sudden interest.</p>

<p>“Well, I found <i>some</i>,” answered the Yankee, with
drawling deliberation, “but not enough to satisfy
me. You see,” he added, “I’ve got two to make
money for.”</p>

<p>“And who are those two?” inquired Fletcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“The first is my old dad—he’s gettin’ kinder
broken down, and can’t work as well as he could
when he was a young man. He’s got a thousand-dollar
mortgage on his farm, and I want to pay that
off. It’ll kinder ease the old man’s mind.”</p>

<p>“That’s a very excellent object, Mr. Stackpole,”
said Harry, who felt still more drawn to his plain,
ungainly, but evidently good-hearted companion.</p>

<p>“I think so myself,” said Obed simply.</p>

<p>“The other person is your wife, I fancy,” said
Fletcher.</p>

<p>“I expect she will be my wife when I get forehanded
enough,” replied Obed. “It’s Suke Stanwood,
one of Farmer Stanwood’s gals. We was
raised together, and we’ve been engaged for nigh
on to five years.”</p>

<p>“Very romantic!” said Fletcher, but there was
a veiled sneer in his tone, as he scanned with contemptuous
amusement the ungainly figure of his
Yankee companion.</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about such things,” said
Obed, “but I guess Suke and I will pull together
well.”</p>

<p>“You are not exactly a young man,” said Fletcher.
“You’ve waited some time.”</p>

<p>“I’m thirty-nine last birthday,” said Obed. “I
was engaged ten years ago, but the girl didn’t know
her own mind, and she ran off with a man that
came along with a photograph saloon. I guess it’s
just as well, for she was always rather flighty.”</p>

<p>“It is very strange she should have deserted a
man of your attractions,” said Fletcher, with a smile.</p>

<p>Harry was indignant at this open ridicule of so
honest and worthy a fellow as Stackpole, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
wondered whether the Yankee would be obtuse
enough not to see it. His doubt was soon solved.</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if you was pokin’ fun at me,
Fletcher,” said Obed, with a quiet, steady look at the
other. “I’m a good-natured fellow in the main, but
I don’t stand any nonsense. I know very well I’m
a rough-looking chap, and I don’t mind your sayin’
so, but I ain’t willin’ to be laughed at.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” said Fletcher smoothly, “you
quite mistake my meaning, I assure you. I am the
last person to laugh at you. I think you are too
modest, though. You are what may be called a
‘rough diamond.’”</p>

<p>“I accept your apology, Fletcher,” said Obed.
“If no offence was meant, none is taken. I don’t
know much about diamonds, rough or smooth, but
at any rate I ain’t a paste one.”</p>

<p>“A good hit! Bravo!” laughed Fletcher. “You
are a man of great penetration, Stackpole, and a
decided acquisition to our party.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you think so,” said Obed dryly. “If I
remember right, you didn’t want me to join you.”</p>

<p>“At first I did not, but I have changed my mind.
I didn’t know you then.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t know you <i>now</i>,” said Obed bluntly.
“If you don’t mind, s’pose you tell us what brought
you out here.”</p>

<p>Fletcher frowned, and regarded the Yankee
suspiciously, as if seeking his motive in asking
this question, but his suspicions were dissipated by
a glance at that honest face, and he answered lightly,
“Really, there isn’t much to tell. My father was a
merchant of Manchester, and tried to make me
follow in his steps, but I was inclined to be wild,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
incurred some debts, and finally threw up business
and came out here.”</p>

<p>“Have you prospered as far as you’ve gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes and no. I’ve made money and I’ve spent
it, and the accounts are about even.”</p>

<p>“That means you haven’t much left.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, my friend, but in your steady
company I mean to turn over a new leaf, and go in
for money and respectability. Now I’ve made a
clean breast of it, and you know all about me.”</p>

<p>In spite of this statement there was not one of his
three companions who did not feel sure that there
was much in Fletcher’s history which he had kept
concealed, and possibly for very good reasons.</p>

<p>The path of a gold-seeker in Australia was beset
with difficulties. The country about Melbourne, and
far inland, was boggy, the soil being volcanic, and
abounding in mud which appears to have no bottom.
The road to the mines was all the worse for having
been ploughed up by bullock teams, and worked
into a slough which proved the discouragement of
mining parties. Some were even months in traversing
the comparatively small distance across the
country to the goal they sought. But the attraction
of money, which is said to make the mare go,
enabled them to triumph at last over the obstacles
that intervened. It was not long before our
party began to understand the nature of the task
they had undertaken. The cart sank up to the
hubs in a bog, and the oxen stood still in patient
despair.</p>

<p>“Well, if this don’t beat all creation!” ejaculated
Obed. “I’ve been in the Western States, and I
thought I knew something about mud, but Australy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
ahead. I say, Fletcher, is there much of this that
we’ve got to go through?”</p>

<p>“Mud’s the rule, and dry land the exception,”
answered Fletcher coolly.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s comfortin’!” remarked Stackpole,
drawing a deep breath. “I s’pose people do get
through after a while.”</p>

<p>“Yes, generally. I was six weeks getting to the
Ovens once.”</p>

<p>“I wish we had some ovens to bake this mud,”
said Obed, with a grim smile at his joke. “It would
take a powerful large one.”</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but dogged perseverance.
It took an hour to get the oxen and cart through a
bog a hundred feet across, and the appearance of
the party, when they finally reached the other side,
was more picturesque than attractive.</p>

<p>Arrived on the other side of the bog, they were
obliged to give the tired cattle a rest. Indeed, they
needed rest themselves.</p>

<p>At the end of the day they made an encampment.
As well as they could judge, they were about eight
miles from Melbourne.</p>

<p>“Eight miles; and how far is the whole distance?”
asked Harry.</p>

<p>“About a hundred miles,” answered Fletcher.</p>

<p>“At this rate we can go through in twelve or
thirteen days, then.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t expect this rate of speed,” said
Fletcher. “We shan’t average over five miles.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope we’ll get paid for it,” said Obed.
“If we don’t I’d better have stayed in Californy.
We haven’t any such mines as this in that
country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“You’d better have stayed there,” said Fletcher
dryly, and he evidently wished that his companion
had done so.</p>

<p>The travellers encamped for the night in a dry
spot among a group of gum trees, and it may readily
be believed that all slept well. The boys felt dead
tired, and it was with difficulty they were awakened
in the morning.</p>

<p>About five o’clock Fletcher opened his eyes. He
was one who slept fast, so to speak, and obtained as
much refreshment from an hour’s sleep as most
people do from a period twice as long. He had been
lying on the ground wrapped in a blanket, as was
the case with the other members of the party.</p>

<p>Raising himself, and leaning on his elbow, he saw
that they were all fast asleep. He nodded with satisfaction,
and getting on his feet he approached Obed
Stackpole with noiseless tread. The Yankee was
sleeping with his mouth wide open, occasionally
emitting a sonorous snore through his aquiline nose.
He was not beautiful to look upon, as Fletcher
evidently thought.</p>

<p>“Ill-favoured brute!” he ejaculated. “I’d like to
choke him!”</p>

<p>If any special advantage had been likely to accrue
to him, Fletcher’s conscience would not have been
likely to stand in the way of violence; but his
purpose now was different.</p>

<p>“The fellow must have gold about him,” muttered
Fletcher. “I wonder whether I can get at it without
waking him up.”</p>

<p>Obed seemed to be in a profound slumber, but it
was a peculiarity of our Yankee friend to wake at
the least touch. This, of course, was not known to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
Dick Fletcher, who felt that there would be no risk
in a careful exploration of Obed’s pockets.</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into one of the Yankee’s
pockets with the practised skill of a pickpocket,
when an entirely unexpected result followed.</p>

<p>“Why, you skunk, what in creation are you
about?” exclaimed Obed, suddenly seizing Fletcher
by the throat.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” said Fletcher, struggling violently,
but ineffectually, to free himself.</p>

<p>“Not till you’ve told me what you are after.”</p>

<p>“Let go, and I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>Obed loosened his grip, saying sternly, “Are you
a pickpocket, my enterprising friend, or what is the
meaning of all this business?”</p>

<p>“You had better not insult me!” said Fletcher
angrily. “I’m no more a pickpocket than you
are.”</p>

<p>“Then what is the meaning of your little game?
Maybe you got up in your sleep.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. I just waked up, and thought I’d
like to have a smoke, but had no matches. I
thought you might have some in your pocket.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you wake me up and ask me?”</p>

<p>“You looked so comfortable, and I thought you
needed rest after a hard day’s work, so I decided to
help myself.”</p>

<p>“It looks like it,” responded Obed dryly. “So
that’s all you were after, was it?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Fletcher, regaining confidence.
“What else could it be?”</p>

<p>“Well, it strikes me it’s rather takin’ a liberty with
a gentleman to search his pockets while he’s asleep,
that’s all! In Californy, Fletcher, if you had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
caught doin’ it, ten chances to one you’d have been
lynched, and lynchin’ isn’t usually regarded as comfortable
or desirable. Where’s your cigar?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any, but I’ve got a pipe.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do happen to have a few matches in my
other pocket, but I’d rather you’d ask for ’em next
time.”</p>

<p>“I will. The fact is, I ought to have brought
some with me. It’s very strange, old traveller as
I am.”</p>

<p>“It would have been a little better than borrowin’
them of a sleepin’ man without leave. Don’t do it
again, Fletcher.”</p>

<small>A VICTIM OF TREACHERY</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_036.jpg" width="91" height="75" alt="“I">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">“I</span> MISTRUST that man Fletcher,” said
Obed to Harry Vane the next day,
taking the opportunity when, at one
of their rests, the man referred to had
sauntered into the woods.</p>

<p>“I don’t like him myself,” said Harry. “Have you
any particular reason for mistrusting him?”</p>

<p>“He was searchin’ my pockets last night when he
thought I was asleep,” answered Obed, and he related
the incident of the night before.</p>

<p>“It looks suspicious,” said Harry. “I have not
much money, but I don’t care to lose what I
have.”</p>

<p>“I should like to shake him, but I don’t see how we
can very well. He’s a reg’lar member of the party.”</p>

<p>“We can be on our guard at any rate,” said Harry.
“I’ll tell Jack, and advise him to be careful also.”</p>

<p>At this point Dick Fletcher returned. He looked
suspiciously from one to the other, under the impression
that something had been said about him. He
asked no questions, however, and no information was
volunteered. He could not but observe, however,
that there was more or less restraint in the manner
of his companions toward him, and that they were
not disposed to be social.</p>

<p>That day they made nine miles, the road being
slightly better than the day before. About five
o’clock they reached a rude wayside inn, over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
door of which was a swinging sign, on which was
printed:</p>

<p class="center2"><span class="bbox">TRAVELLERS’ REST.</span></p>

<p>“We might as well stop here, instead of camping
out,” said Fletcher.</p>

<p>“I’m agreeable,” said Obed, “if the tax isn’t too
high.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Linton is moderate in his charges,” said
Fletcher. “I’ve known him a good while. He’s a
good fellow.”</p>

<p>This was not a very valuable recommendation in
the opinion of Obed and the two boys, but they
had no objection to becoming guests of the establishment.</p>

<p>It was a rude building, and the accommodations
were very limited. In fact, there were but two
sleeping rooms. One of these Fletcher occupied,
and the other was given up to the other members
of the party, there being two beds.</p>

<p>“I’d rather bunk in with you, if you don’t mind,”
said Stackpole to Harry. “I don’t feel easy in the
same room with Fletcher.”</p>

<p>“We shall be very glad of your company, Mr.
Stackpole.”</p>

<p>“If I snore, just come and turn me over. I don’t
want to disturb nobody.”</p>

<p>“I think Jack and I will be too sound asleep to
be disturbed by your snoring,” said Harry, with a
laugh. “However, if there is any occasion, I will
follow your directions.”</p>

<p>The landlord was a broad-shouldered man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
moderate stature, who had lost the sight of one
eye. The other, being covered with a green shade,
gave him an ill look. His manner, however, was
hearty, and showed a bluff, offhand cordiality, as
he welcomed the party to the hospitalities of the
Travellers’ Rest. He was familiarly called “Larry”
by Fletcher, who greeted him like an old comrade.</p>

<p>The supper consisted in part of their own supplies,
with some small additions from the larder of the inn.
It was, at any rate, an improvement upon their camp
fare, and the boys enjoyed it.</p>

<p>After supper they sat down on a settle in front
of the inn, but presently Fletcher strayed away into
the woods at the back of the house. Some fifteen
minutes later Larry Linton also got up, but ostentatiously
went in a different direction.</p>

<p>“I’m going a little ways to a squatter’s to speak
about some vegetables,” he said.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind company, I’ll go along too,”
said Obed.</p>

<p>“Better not,” answered Larry. “There’s a boggy
spot which a stranger is likely to fall into.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough of bogs,” said Obed, shrugging
his shoulders. “Seems to me you haven’t got much
besides bogs out in Australy.”</p>

<p>So Linton went off by himself. After he was fairly
out of the way, Obed said, turning to the two boys,
“Did you think I wanted to go off with Linton?”</p>

<p>“I supposed so, as you made the proposal.”</p>

<p>“I only wanted to find out if he wanted me or
not. I have my suspicions.”</p>

<p>“What kind of suspicions?”</p>

<p>Harry was the speaker, as usual, for Jack never
took the lead when Harry was present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Fletcher and Linton are too thick together to
suit me,” answered the Yankee. “Looks as if they
was in league together.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they have arranged a meeting?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I do think.”</p>

<p>“But they have gone in different directions,”
objected Jack.</p>

<p>“Bless your simple heart, my boy, that’s done
on purpose,” said Obed. “Can’t they fetch round
together without our knowing it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of that,” Jack admitted.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stackpole,” said Harry, after a moment’s
thought, “if you and Jack will keep each other
company, I will explore a little myself. I may
happen to be at the conference.”</p>

<p>“Be careful if you do, Harry,” said Obed. “Don’t
run no risk.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look out for that.”</p>

<p>In the rear of the house, and almost reaching
to it, was a forest of eucalyptus trees. It was
unfavourable to Harry’s purpose that these trees
rise straight from the ground, and are not encumbered
with underbrush. It was very pleasant
walking though, and Harry sauntered along at his
leisure. He almost forgot the object of his enterprise,
until some half-an-hour later, in the stillness of
the woods, his quick ear caught the sound of voices.</p>

<p>He was instantly on the alert. The voices, he
doubted not, were those of Dick Fletcher and Larry
Linton. He moved forward cautiously, and soon
espied the speakers. They were sitting on the
ground, under the over-reaching boughs of a gigantic
tree. Harry managed to get near enough to listen
to the conversation, being himself concealed from
view behind the trunk of a neighbouring tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Is there much money in the party?” he heard
Linton ask.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you. The boys haven’t got much,
but that long-legged Yankee has probably got considerable.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a man is he?”</p>

<p>“He’s likely to prove a troublesome customer. He
is muscular, as you can see, and not easily scared.”</p>

<p>“Has he any suspicion of you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I put my foot in it the other night.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“I saw him sleeping like a boy, and thought there
was no danger of his waking up, so I took the liberty
to explore his pockets. Before I could say Jack
Robinson he had me by the throat, and wanted to
know what I was after.”</p>

<p>“That was awkward. How did you get out of it?”</p>

<p>“Lied out! Told him I was looking for matches,
as I wanted a smoke.”</p>

<p>“Did he swallow it down?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t contradict me, but it has made him
watchful and suspicious. If I’d got the money, I
was ready to make tracks, and leave them to find
their way as they could.”</p>

<p>At this point the two rose and walked away,
leaving Harry in his position behind the tree. As
soon as he thought it was safe he came out, and
made the best of his way to the inn, getting there
about fifteen minutes before Fletcher appeared, but
without the landlord. During that interval he had
time to communicate what he had heard to Obed
Stackpole.</p>

<p>“Just what I expected!” said Obed. “The
treacherous skunk! So he’s in league with the
landlord, is he? I’ll fix him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>He cautioned the two boys not to show by their
manner that they had made any discovery, but to
appear as usual.</p>

<p>The next morning the party started as usual.
They plodded on for almost a mile, when Obed,
turning quickly to Fletcher, said:</p>

<p>“Let me look at that weapon of yours a minute.”</p>

<p>Fletcher unsuspiciously handed it over.</p>

<p>“I think I shall <i>keep</i> this, Fletcher,” said Obed,
eyeing him steadily. “I’m pained to have to bid you
good-bye.”</p>

<p>“What does all this mean?” blustered Fletcher.</p>

<p>“It means that your room is better than your
company. We’d better part.”</p>

<p>“Would you rob me? That revolver is mine, and
I paid for a share of the things in the cart.”</p>

<p>“I’ll allow you the vally of them and pay you on
the spot, but we can’t go on together.”</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, Mr. Stackpole
handed over a handsome sum of money.</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to sell my revolver,” repeated
Fletcher. “What am I to do out here alone and
unarmed?”</p>

<p>“You’d better go back to your friend Larry Linton.
He’ll look out for you.”</p>

<p>“You will regret this high-handed proceeding!”
exclaimed Fletcher angrily.</p>

<p>“Maybe I shall, and maybe I shan’t,” answered
Obed indifferently. “I’ll risk it.”</p>

<p>Fletcher halted a moment as if undecided, then
turned back, and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>All the party felt relieved to be rid of Fletcher.
Without being able to prove anything against him,
all believed him to be unworthy of confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“I feel about tired out,” said Obed, about the
middle of the afternoon, just after he had extricated
the team, by great personal effort, from a morass.
“If I’d ’a’ known as much of the country before
startin’ I wouldn’t have started at all.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long road that has no ending,” said Harry,
smiling. He, too, was very tired, but youth is
hopeful.</p>

<p>“It’s the worst country I ever travelled in, by a
long shot. If I ever make my pile I’ll take the first
steamer back to Frisco.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” suddenly exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>Obed and Harry, looking up, saw a forlorn-looking
figure approaching them. It was a man of middle
age, and emaciated in appearance, looking the image
of despair. He tottered rather than walked, from
exceeding weakness.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake give me something to eat! I
am almost famished,” he cried.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly, friend,” answered Obed, rising
and advancing to meet the stranger. “We don’t
keep a first-class hotel, but you’re welcome to what
we’ve got. Are you travellin’ alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you call it travelling. I’ve been dragging
myself along for several days, hoping to find somebody
that would give me aid.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve found somebody. Here, sit down,
for you don’t seem able to stand, and we’ll provide
for you. Harry, bring some biscuits and cold meat,
won’t you, and Jack had better build a fire. A cup
of tea will put new life into you, my friend.”</p>

<p>The biscuits were soaked in water and given to the
stranger. He devoured them like a man in the last
stages of hunger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Go slow, my friend. Your stomach must be
weak,” said Obed.</p>

<p>“If you only knew the gnawing at my vitals,” said
the new-comer. “I have not tasted food for three
days.”</p>

<p>“I never was in that fix, though I did go hungry
for twenty-four hours once in Californy.”</p>

<p>“That goes to the right spot,” said the stranger,
after he had gulped down two cups of tea. “Now
I’m ready to die without complaining.”</p>

<p>“If it’s all the same to you, I think you’d better
get ready to live,” said Obed.</p>

<p>“I’d rather die now than suffer as I have done in
the last three days.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have to. We’ve got plenty and to
spare.”</p>

<p>“But I have no money. I have been robbed of
everything.”</p>

<p>“Robbed! How is that?”</p>

<p>“It’s rather a long story. You may not have
patience to hear it.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got time enough, and patience enough,
but perhaps you don’t feel strong enough to talk.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t before you relieved my hunger. The
food and the tea have put new life into me, as you
predicted they would.”</p>

<p>“Then go ahead, stranger. We’re all anxious to
hear your story.”</p>

<p>“I am an Englishman,” began the unknown, “and
my name is Ralph Granger. When the report
reached England of the richness of the Australian
goldfields, I sold out my business, and was among
the first to come out here. By the sale of my business
I realised about five hundred pounds. Three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
hundred I left with my wife—I have no children—to
keep her while I was gone. It is very fortunate
that I took this precaution and left her so well provided
for, since had I brought all my money with me,
it would all have been lost.”</p>

<p>The three adventurers looked at each other
soberly. The ill fortune of their new acquaintance
did not augur very well for their good fortune.</p>

<p>“Then you had bad luck,” said Harry inquiringly.</p>

<p>“On the contrary I had good luck,” replied the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Good luck!” repeated Harry in surprise. “Then
how——”</p>

<p>“How did I come into this plight? That is what
you were about to ask?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You will soon learn. On reaching this country I
was in doubt whether to go to Ballarat or Bendigo
but finally decided upon the latter.”</p>

<p>“We are bound for Bendigo,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“So I inferred. Ballarat is in a different direction.
Very well, I reached Bendigo three months since.
For a time I was unlucky. I found next to no gold,
and the prices of living used up about all the money
I had left after the expense of getting there. Just
when I was on the point of giving up in despair I
made a strike, and during the next six weeks I
unearthed gold to the value of a thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>“That certainly wasn’t bad fortune.”</p>

<p>“It was extraordinarily good fortune, and naturally
drew the attention of the rest of the camp. This was
unfortunate, for in such a settlement, as may well be
supposed, there are many reckless adventurers, ex-convicts,
and men utterly destitute of principle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“Then you were robbed at the camp?”</p>

<p>“Not then nor there. I took the precaution to
send the greater part of my money to Melbourne by
experts. Destitute and lost, I have six hundred
pounds in Melbourne awaiting my arrival; but for
all that, I should probably have starved to death
but for my opportune meeting with you.”</p>

<p>“Come, then, you’ve got something to live for
after all,” said Obed.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right. Let me once get to Melbourne
and I am all right. I shall buy a passage
ticket to Liverpool, and carry with me the balance of
my money. With all that I have lost I shall go
home richer than I came.”</p>

<p>“But how did you lose your money?” asked Jack
who was eager to have his curiosity gratified.</p>

<p>“When I got ready to leave the goldfields, there
was no party which I could join. I did not like to
go alone. In this emergency a man who had been
working an adjoining claim offered to go with me.
I saw no reason to distrust him, and accepted his
proposal. All went pleasantly for three days, but on
the morning of the fourth day when I awoke I found
myself alone. A little startled, I felt for my gold,
which I carried in a belt around my waist. It was
gone, and so was my horse. Of course you guess how
it happened. My companion had robbed me during
the night, and left me in the woods utterly destitute.”</p>

<p>“What was the name of your companion?” asked
Obed quickly.</p>

<p>“He called himself Fletcher.”</p>

<p>“I thought so!” exclaimed Obed, slapping his leg
with emphasis. “We know the gentleman a little
ourselves.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>A DISAGREEABLE SURPRISE</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap2" src="images/i_046.jpg" width="91" height="75" alt="“Y">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">“Y</span>OU have not met Dick Fletcher?” said
Ralph Granger in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, we only parted from him this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Did he rob you?”</p>

<p>“No, but he tried to.”</p>

<p>Here Obed gave an account of Fletcher’s searching
his pockets during the night.</p>

<p>“I am afraid he will turn up again,” said Granger
apprehensively.</p>

<p>“We’ll try to be ready for him,” said Obed coolly,
“but I don’t mean to borrow any trouble.”</p>

<p>By this time their new acquaintance had satisfied
his hunger. He turned gratefully to Obed Stackpole.</p>

<p>“How can I thank you for your great kindness?”
he said earnestly. “I feel that you have saved my
life.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” said Obed, “I’ve only done as you
would have done in my place. How long is it since
you parted company with that skunk, Fletcher?”</p>

<p>“I think it is only seven days, but it has seemed a
month.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t you meet anybody humane enough to
relieve your hunger?”</p>

<p>“During the first four days, but not for the last
three. Part of the time I lost my way, and did not
meet any one. I hope you will never know such
torments as I have known in that time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“Amen to that! And now, my friend, what are
your plans?”</p>

<p>“I should like to go back to Melbourne,” said the
stranger hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“If you say so, we’ll fit you out with three days’
provisions, and you can push on.”</p>

<p>“I hardly like to go alone.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, for your sake, that we are going the
other way. You see we haven’t made our pile yet,
and must go on. I’ll tell you what you’d better do,
Granger. Come along with us, and join the first
party we meet bound for the city. You will, at all
events, be sure of your victuals till then.”</p>

<p>“I believe your advice to be good, and will accept
your kind invitation. The tea and food have put
new life in me, and my strength has returned.”</p>

<p>They did not travel long together, however, for
before nightfall they fell in with a party of eight
persons bound for Melbourne, who agreed to let
him join them.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Granger,” said Obed, as they parted.
“I think you’re all right now.”</p>

<p>Toward the close of the day they entered a much
pleasanter country. In place of sandy clay, baked
hard in the sun, alternating here and there with
a moist bog, they came to tall grass, trees of great
height, and meadows suitable for grazing. The
cattle revelled in the rich feed, and Obed suffered
them to eat their fill, feeling that they had worked
hard and deserved it. Though it was rather earlier
than usual, they decided to encamp for the night
near the margin of a creek, shaded by trees of a
gigantic size.</p>

<p>They slept soundly all night, but they got ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
to move at seven, the boys having made sure of
a bath first. They were not to proceed far, however.
About ten o’clock, as they were skirting the
woods, six men on horseback rode out from the
leafy covert. They seemed inclined to dispute the
passage of the party.</p>

<p>“What can they want?” ejaculated Harry, with
a startled look.</p>

<p>“I expect they are bushrangers,” said Obed.</p>

<small>FLETCHER TURNS UP AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">H</span>ARRY didn’t need to be told that bushrangers
in Australia correspond to bandits
in Italy and highwaymen in other
countries. Stories of their outrages were
common enough, and among the dangers
apprehended in a journey to or from the mines, that
of meeting with a party of this gentry was perhaps
the most dreaded.</p>

<p>Though Obed Stackpole betrayed no emotion, but
was outwardly quiet, his heart sank within him
when he saw the bushrangers strung along the road.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Harry had been scanning the faces
of the men who confronted them, and made a
surprising discovery.</p>

<p>“Look, Obed,” he said eagerly, “at that man on
the extreme right.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stackpole did look.</p>

<p>“Dick Fletcher!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>But at this point the leader of the bushrangers
broke silence.</p>

<p>“Do you surrender?” he asked in brief, commanding
accents.</p>

<p>“I think we shall have to, squire,” answered Obed,
to whom the demand was naturally addressed.</p>

<p>“You must give up what money you have about
you,” was the next demand.</p>

<p>“It’s mighty inconvenient, squire. I’m a good
many thousand miles away from home, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Peace, fool! Produce whatever you have of value.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got much. You’ve tackled the wrong
man, squire.”</p>

<p>“Fletcher, search that man!” said the captain of
the band.</p>

<p>Dick Fletcher dismounted from his horse, and with
evident alacrity advanced to the side of the Yankee.</p>

<p>“I think we’ve met before,” said Obed significantly.</p>

<p>“I think we have,” said the outlaw, showing his
teeth. “I told you we should meet again.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say I’m overjoyed at the meeting. However,
I respect you more now, when you show yourself
in your true colours, than when you sneaked up
to me at night, and searched my pockets, pretending
all the while to be a friend.”</p>

<p>“Take care how you talk!” said Fletcher, frowning.
“Yesterday you were three to one, now you
are in my power.”</p>

<p>“So you’re a highway robber, are you, Fletcher?
Well, I can’t say I’m very much surprised. I guess
that’s what you’re most fit for.”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to kill you?” said Fletcher,
touching his hip pocket. “It isn’t safe for you to
insult me.”</p>

<p>“Just so! You have a right to be brave with all
them men at your side.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing there, Dick Fletcher?
Why don’t you proceed to business?” demanded
the leader impatiently.</p>

<p>“Empty your pockets, Stackpole!” said Fletcher,
in a peremptory tone.</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>The Yankee plunged his hands into his pockets,
and produced in succession a jack-knife, a plug of
tobacco, a bunch of keys, and a couple of buttons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Take them, Fletcher,” he said, “if you want ’em
more than I do.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean with this tomfoolery?” demanded
Fletcher, perceiving an impatient frown on
the face of his chief. “Hand over your money.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll have to search me, Fletcher.
You’ve done it before,” answered Obed imperturbably.
“I’ve mislaid my money, and you may know
where it is better than I do.”</p>

<p>Fletcher took him at his word, and proceeded to
search, using some roughness about it.</p>

<p>“Be careful, Fletcher,” said Obed. “I’m a tender
plant, and mustn’t be roughly handled.”</p>

<p>Every pocket was searched, but no money was
found. Dick Fletcher looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“I can’t find anything,” he said to the captain.</p>

<p>“Rip open his clothes,” said the leader impatiently.
“He has some place of concealment for
his gold, but it won’t avail. We shall find it.”</p>

<p>Fletcher whipped out a knife and was about to
obey directions, but Obed anticipated him.</p>

<p>“I’ll save you the trouble, Fletcher,” he said.
“As you’re bound to have the money, I may as well
give it up. Just hand over that jack-knife, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>Fletcher hesitated, not understanding his meaning.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll give it back to you if you want it, but I
need it to get the money.”</p>

<p>Upon this the knife was given back to him.</p>

<p>Obed cut open the lining of his pantaloons, and
drew out four five-pound bank-notes. They were
creased and soiled, but this did not impair their
value.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s what you were after,” said Obed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
“I can’t say you’re welcome to them, but that doesn’t
make any difference to you, I take it.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you’ve got?” demanded the chief of
the bushrangers, looking very much disappointed.</p>

<p>“Every cent, squire.”</p>

<p>The leader turned to Fletcher.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you tell us this man was well fixed?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” answered Fletcher, crestfallen.</p>

<p>“I thought you <i>knew</i> it. Why, this is a contemptibly
small sum, and doesn’t pay for our
trouble.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, squire,” said Obed. “It ain’t worth
carryin’ away. You may as well give it back,
Fletcher.”</p>

<p>“That’s a different matter,” continued the captain.
“Once more, is that all the money you have
about you?”</p>

<p>“It is, squire.”</p>

<p>“Be careful what you say, for if we catch you in a
lie, we’ll string you up to the nearest tree.”</p>

<p>“It’s as true as preachin’, squire. I never lie.
I’m like Washington. I dare say you’ve heard of
him.”</p>

<p>A further search was made, but no money was
found, luckily for Obed, since there is reason to
believe that the outlaw would have carried out his
threat.</p>

<p>“The fellow here fooled you, Fletcher,” said the
captain sternly. “Take care how you bring us any
more false reports.”</p>

<p>“There are the boys,” suggested Fletcher uncomfortable
under the rebuke.</p>

<p>“Search them also.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>This was done, or rather it would have been done,
had not Harry and Jack, fully realising the futility
of resistance, produced promptly all the money they
had. So much, however, had been spent on the
outfit, that between them they could only muster
about seven pounds.</p>

<p>“Humph!” said the captain contemptuously,
“that’s a big haul, upon my word!”</p>

<p>“There are the cattle and supplies,” said Fletcher.</p>

<p>“They will be of use. Here, Peter, do you and
Hugh drive the team into the woods, and prepare
some dinner for the band. We will be there
directly.”</p>

<p>Two men, unmounted, who seemed to be servants,
came forward, and proceeded to obey orders.</p>

<p>“Hold on, squire!” exclaimed Obed in alarm
“You ain’t goin’ to take our team, are you?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly I am. If you had had a large
sum in money, we would have spared you this. As
it is, we must have them.”</p>

<p>“But we shall starve, without money or food.”</p>

<p>“That is nothing to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys, come along,” said Obed in a despondent
tone. “Our prospects ain’t over bright, but
something may turn up.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was a quiet conference among
the bushrangers.</p>

<p>“Hold!” said the captain, as Harry and Jack
were about to leave the scene with their older companion.
“<i>You</i> can go,” turning to Obed, “but the
boys remain with us.”</p>

<p>Harry and Jack exchanged a glance of dismay. To
be stripped of all they had was a serious misfortune,
but in addition to be made prisoners by the bushrangers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
was something of which they had not
dreamed. Obed, too, was taken aback. He had
become attached to his young companions, and he
was very sorry to part with them. He could not
forbear a remonstrance.</p>

<p>“Look here, squire,” he said familiarly to the
captain, “what do you want to keep the boys for?
They won’t do you any good, and it’ll cost considerable
to keep ’em. They’re pretty hearty.”</p>

<p>Harry and Jack could not help laughing at this
practical argument.</p>

<p>The captain of the bushrangers frowned.</p>

<p>“I am the best judge of that,” he said. “You are
lucky to be let off yourself. Don’t meddle with
matters that don’t concern you.”</p>

<p>“Take me, if you want to,” said Obed independently.
“I shall be lonesome without the boys.”</p>

<p>“You had better go while there is a chance,”
said the captain menacingly. “If you give me any
more trouble, I will have my men tie you to a tree
and leave you here.”</p>

<p>Harry was afraid the threat would be carried out,
and begged Obed to make no further intercession.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt we shall meet again,” he said.
“These gentlemen will no doubt release us soon.”</p>

<p>He was by no means confident of this, but he
thought it politic to take things cheerfully.</p>

<p>“The boy has sense,” said the captain approvingly.</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye, boys,” said Obed, wringing the
hands of his two young friends. “I shall feel
awfully lonely, that’s a fact, but as you say, we may
meet again.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Obed,” said each boy, trying not to
look as sorrowful as he felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Obed Stackpole turned and walked slowly away.
His prospects were by no means bright, for he was
left without money or provisions in the Australian
wilderness, but at that moment he thought only of
losing the companionship of the two boys, and was
troubled by the thought that they might come to
harm among the bushrangers.</p>

<p>“If I only knew where they were goin’ to take
’em,” he said to himself, “I’d foller and see if I
couldn’t help ’em to escape.”</p>

<p>To follow at once, however, he felt would be
in the highest degree imprudent, and he continued
to move away slowly, but without any definite idea
of where he intended to go.</p>

<p>“Follow me, men,” said the leader. He turned
his horse’s head and rode into the wood.</p>

<p>The eucalyptus trees are very tall, some attaining
a height of hundreds of feet. They begin to branch
high up, and there being little if any underbrush in
the neighbourhood, there was nothing to prevent the
passage of mounted horsemen. The ground was dry
also, and the absence of bogs and marshy ground
was felt to be a great relief.</p>

<p>The boys were on foot, and so were two or three of
the bushranger’s party. As already intimated, they
were of inferior rank and employed as attendants.
In general the party was silent, and the boys overheard
a little conversation between the captain and
Dick Fletcher, who rode beside him.</p>

<p>“You haven’t distinguished yourself this time,
Fletcher,” said the chief in a dissatisfied tone. “You
led me to think that this party had money enough
to repay us for our trouble.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t my fault,” said Fletcher, in an apologetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
tone. “The Yankee completely deceived me. He
was always boasting of his money.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem like that kind of a man,” said
the captain thoughtfully. “What could have been
his object?”</p>

<p>“He must have meant to fool me. I am ashamed
to say he did.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you have found out whether his boasts
were correct?”</p>

<p>“That is just what I tried to do,” answered
Fletcher. “I crept to his side early one morning,
and began to explore his pockets, but he woke up in
an instant and cut up rough. He seized me by the
throat, and I thought he would choke me. That
made me think all the more that he carried a good
deal of money about with him.”</p>

<p>“The boys, too—did you think they were worth
plundering?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I never was deceived about them,”
replied Fletcher promptly. “I concluded that, even if
they had money, the Yankee was their guardian, and
took care of it. They are all Americans, you know.”</p>

<p>He spoke glibly, and the captain appeared to
credit his statements. The boys listened with interest
and with a new appreciation of Fletcher’s
character. They could easily have disproved one
of his statements, for they knew very well that Obed
never boasted of his money, nor gave any one a right
to suppose that he carried much with him. On this
point he was very reticent, and neither of them knew
much of his circumstances. However, it would have
done no good to contradict Fletcher, for his word with
the captain would have outweighed theirs, and he would
have found a way to punish them for their interference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“In future,” said the captain, “I advise you to
make sure that the game is worth bagging. As it is,
you have led us on a fool’s errand.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” Fletcher admitted, “but it wasn’t
so last time. The Scotch merchant bled freely, you
must allow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did better then.”</p>

<p>As Harry listened he began to understand that
Fletcher acted as a decoy, to ingratiate himself with
parties leaving Melbourne for the mines, and then
giving secret information to the bushrangers with
whom he was connected, enabling them to attack
and plunder his unsuspecting companions.</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty mean sort of business,” he said to
Jack, when he had an opportunity to speak to him
without being overheard. “I’d rather be a robber
right out than lure people into danger.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” responded Jack. “That Fletcher’s
worse than a pirate.”</p>

<p>So they went on, but slowly, that the boys, though
compelled to walk, had little difficulty in keeping up.
They were necessarily anxious, but their predominant
feeling was of curiosity as to their destination, and as
to the bushrangers’ mode of life.</p>

<p>At length they came out of the woods into more
open ground.</p>

<p>On a slight rise stood a collection of huts, covered
with sheets of the bark of the gum-tree, held on by
ties of bullock hide. For the most part they contained
but one room each. One, however, was large,
and, the boys afterwards learned, was occupied by
the captain of the bushrangers. Another served as
a stable for the horses of the party.</p>

<p>This Harry judged to be the home of the outlaws,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
for no sooner had they come in sight of it than they
leaped from their horses and led them up to the
stable, relieving them of their saddles. Then the
bushrangers sat down on the ground, and lounged
at their ease. The attendants forthwith made preparations
for a meal, appropriating the stores which
had just been taken from Obed and the boys. The
captives were not sorry that there was a prospect of
a meal, for by this time they were hungry. They
followed the example of their companions, and threw
themselves down on the ground.</p>

<p>Next to them was a young bushranger, apparently
about twenty-two years of age, who had a pleasant
face, indicative of good humour.</p>

<p>“How do you like our home?” he asked, turning
to Harry with a smile.</p>

<p>“It is a pleasant place,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>“How would you like to live here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should like it,” Harry replied
honestly.</p>

<p>“And why not? Is it not better than to be pent
up in a city? Here we breathe the pure air of the
woods; we listen to the songs of the birds; we are
not chained to the desk or confined from morning
till night in a close office.”</p>

<p>“That is true, but are there not some things you
do not like about it,” asked Harry significantly.</p>

<p>“Such as what?”</p>

<p>“Is it not better to earn your living, even if you
are chained to a desk, than to get it as you
do?”</p>

<p>Harry felt that he was rather bold in asking this
question, but he was reassured by the pleasant face
of the young outlaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Well,” admitted the latter, “there are some objections
to our life.”</p>

<p>“It would not do for all to get their living as
you do.”</p>

<p>“That is true. Some must work, in order that
others may relieve them of a portion of their property.”</p>

<p>“Are you not afraid of being interfered with?”</p>

<p>“By the mounted police?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“We are strong enough to overcome them,” said
the bushranger carelessly.</p>

<p>“What is the name of your captain?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>“Stockton. No doubt you heard of him in Melbourne.”</p>

<p>Harry shook his head.</p>

<p>The outlaw seemed surprised. “I thought everybody
in Australia had heard of Ben Stockton,” he
said. “He has a great name,” he added with evident
pride. “He is as strong as a lion, fears nothing, and
his name is associated with some of the most daring
robberies that have ever taken place in this country.”</p>

<p>“And still he is free,” said Harry suggestively.</p>

<p>“The authorities are afraid of him. They have
offered a reward for his capture, but it doesn’t trouble
him. He only laughs at it.”</p>

<p>They were far enough away from the rest of the
party to carry on their conversation unheard—otherwise,
neither Harry nor his informant would have
ventured to speak with so much freedom. At this
eulogium, however, Harry scanned, with some curiosity,
the face and figure of the famous bushranger,
who was sitting about three rods distant. He was
a man of large frame, powerfully built, with hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and beard black as night, and keen, penetrating eyes
that seemed to look through those upon whom they
were fixed. He had about him an air of command
and conscious authority, so that the merest stranger
could not mistake his office. About his mouth there
was something which indicated sternness and cruelty.
He was a man to inspire fear, and Harry, after a
steady examination, felt no surprise at the man’s
reputation.</p>

<p>“How long has he been captain?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Ever since I joined the band,” answered the young
man. “I don’t know how much longer.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been a member of the band?”</p>

<p>“Five years.”</p>

<p>“You must have been a mere boy when you
joined.”</p>

<p>“I was seventeen. I am twenty-two now.”</p>

<p>“I should like to ask you a question, but you may
not like to answer it.”</p>

<p>“Go on! If I don’t care to answer, I will tell you so.”</p>

<p>“What induced you to join the bushrangers?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” said the young man, showing
neither offence nor reluctance. “I was employed
in Melbourne in a business establishment. One of
my fellow-clerks stole some money, and, to screen
himself, managed to implicate me by concealing a
part of the stolen money in my coat pocket. I knew
no way to prove my innocence, and my employer
was not a man to show pity, so I escaped from
Melbourne and took refuge in the bush. There I
fell in with Captain Stockton, who offered me a place
in his band. I accepted, and here I am.”</p>

<p>“But for the act of your fellow-clerk you would
have been an honest business man to-day, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“Very likely.”</p>

<p>“What a pity!” said Harry regretfully, for he
was much attracted by the open face and pleasant
manners of the young man.</p>

<p>“So I thought at first, but I became used to it.
After a while I grew to like the free life of the
bush.”</p>

<p>“I don’t call it free. You can’t go back to Melbourne
for fear of arrest.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I have been there several times,” said the
young man carelessly.</p>

<p>“How did you manage it?” asked Harry, puzzled.</p>

<p>“I disguised myself. Sometimes the captain sends
me on special business.”</p>

<p>“Like Fletcher?” asked Harry quickly.</p>

<p>“No; I shouldn’t like that work. It suits him,
however.”</p>

<p>“I never should have taken you for a bushranger.
You look too honest.”</p>

<p>The other laughed.</p>

<p>“I think I was meant to be an honest man,” he
said. “That is, I am better suited to it. But fate
ordained otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Fate?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I believe that everything that happens to
us is fated, and could not have been otherwise.”</p>

<p>“You think, then, that you were fated to be a
bushranger?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it.”</p>

<p>“That, then, accounts for it not troubling you.”</p>

<p>“You are right. We can’t kick against fate, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like to believe as you do,” said Harry
earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“You’ll come to believe it sooner or later,” said
the outlaw, with an air of conviction.</p>

<p>“Then what is the use of trying to lead a good
and honourable life?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I say. There isn’t any use.”</p>

<p>Harry had never before met any one holding such
views of fate. He was interested but repelled. He
felt that he could not and would not accept any
such idea, and he said so.</p>

<p>“You’ll change your mind after you become one
of us,” said his companion.</p>

<p>“After what?” ejaculated Harry.</p>

<p>“I suppose you know you are to become one of us.”</p>

<p>“But that will never be. How can you think
such a thing!”</p>

<p>“Because I know it is to be. Why do you think
the captain brought you here? He had your money,
and couldn’t get any more out of you.”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean what you say?” asked
Harry, his heart filled with a sickening apprehension
that this might be true.</p>

<p>“Of course I do. The captain likes young people.
You two boys are smart and bright, and he is going
to make you members of the band.”</p>

<p>“He can’t! I’ll die first!” exclaimed Harry, with
suppressed energy.</p>

<p>“You will see. But hush! don’t speak so loud. For
my part I shall be very glad to have you among us.”</p>

<p>At this moment their companion was called away,
and Harry, bending toward Jack, whispered in his
ear: “I am afraid he is right about the captain’s
intentions. We must try to escape as soon as there
is any chance.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” Jack whispered back.</p>

<small>A TRIAL AND ITS TRAGIC FINALE</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_063.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="H">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">H</span>ARRY was very much disturbed by the
communication of his new acquaintance,
whose name he ascertained to be Wyman.
It was not very pleasant, of course, to
be a prisoner, but this he could have borne,
being confident, sooner or later, of escaping. But to be
forced to join these lawless men, and render himself,
like them, an outlaw and outcast from respectable
society, seemed terrible. He determined that, come
what would, he would preserve his integrity and his
honest name. He might be ill-treated, but they
could not force him to become a bushranger. He
talked the matter over with Jack, and the young
sailor agreed with him.</p>

<p>Presently the meal was ready, and the two boys
were served with the rest. Notwithstanding their
precarious position, each ate heartily. It takes a
good deal to spoil the appetite of a growing boy.</p>

<p>After eating, the captain, clearing his throat,
addressed the band.</p>

<p>“My men,” he said, “we have refreshed ourselves
by eating, and now a less pleasant scene awaits us.
I am your captain, and to me you have sworn
implicit obedience. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” answered the bushrangers.</p>

<p>“But one thing is essential. There must be no
traitor, no malcontents among us. A large reward
has been offered for my apprehension—five thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
pounds! It shows how much they are afraid of
us,” and he raised his head with conscious pride.
“Against open enemies we can hold our own, but
not against the secret foe who sits beside us as a
friend, and eats and drinks with us. When such
a one is found, what shall be his fate?”</p>

<p>He paused for a reply, and it came from the lips
of all in one stern word—“Death!”</p>

<p>“I am answered,” said the captain. “The sentence
has been pronounced, not by my lips but by your own.”</p>

<p>Here he turned to two attendants, who were
stationed near at hand. “Bring forth the traitor,”
he said.</p>

<p>The two men disappeared within one of the huts,
and immediately reappeared, leading behind them
a third, with his hands tied behind him. His face
was covered by a black cloth, which effectually
screened his features.</p>

<p>“Complete your task!” said the captain, with a
wave of his hand.</p>

<p>The two guards set the offender with his back to
a tree, and producing a rope, quickly passed it
round his waist and tied him securely, with his
screened face toward the band.</p>

<p>“Wretch!” said the captain in a terrible voice,
“you thought to betray us, and expose us to punishment
and death, but the doom which you were
ready to bring upon us has recoiled upon yourself.
You would have sold your captain and comrades
for gold. They have pronounced your doom, and it
is <i>Death</i>! Have you anything to say?”</p>

<p>The victim did not speak, but slowly inclined his
head in hopeless submission to his fate.</p>

<p>“You have nothing to say for yourself. Is there
any one to speak for you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>One of the bushrangers sprang forward impetuously.
“Yes, captain, I will speak for him.”</p>

<p>Captain Stockton frowned fiercely, but uttered one
word, “Speak!”</p>

<p>The daring outlaw, who had stepped forward a
little from the line, commenced: “This man is my
brother. We were nursed by the same mother, we
played together by the same fireside, we grew into
manhood together, and together we joined this band
of brothers.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and the captain said briefly,
“Well?”</p>

<p>“Now,” continued the brother, “you would condemn
him to a shameful death, which he does not
deserve.”</p>

<p>“Was he not caught attempting to escape?
Answer me instantly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he had no intention of betraying any of us.”</p>

<p>“What then was his object?” demanded Captain
Stockton sternly.</p>

<p>“He meant to leave you. He had become tired
of the life of a bushranger. He wished to return
to the paths of honesty, and live by labour at some
respectable trade.”</p>

<p>“And why was this? Why, after so many years,
had he become tired of our noble independence?”</p>

<p>“In one of his missions, undertaken in the interest
of the fraternity, he had made the acquaintance of a
young girl, modest and attractive. He wished to
marry her, but as a bushranger he knew this was
impossible. Therefore, he resolved to leave our
band, and enter upon a new life. He would never
have uttered a word to imperil the safety of his
captain or his comrades.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“And you expect us to believe this?” said the
captain with a sneer.</p>

<p>“I do. I swear it is true.”</p>

<p>“And what do you expect me to do, Robert
Graham?”</p>

<p>“To consider his temptations, and to show mercy
upon him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps also you expect me to release him, and bid
him go his way to the maiden who is waiting for him.”</p>

<p>“It would be a generous act.”</p>

<p>“But I am not so generous,” said the captain.
“Your plea is ingenious, but I put no faith in it. It
is utterly improbable. What he sought was blood
money.”</p>

<p>“No, a thousand times, no!” exclaimed the brother
earnestly.</p>

<p>“I say it is so,” said Captain Stockton harshly.
“It is plain to every member of the band. Yet,
because you have never transgressed I have been
willing to listen to you, remembering that he is your
brother.”</p>

<p>“Spare his life at least; even if you are convinced
that he is guilty. He has not lived his life half out.
Be merciful!”</p>

<p>“I cannot,” answered the captain, in an inflexible
tone. “If I yielded to such a weakness all discipline
would be at an end. If treachery is pardoned, who
knows which one among you might be the next to
imitate the example of this man. No! justice is
stern, and punishment must be inflicted. The guilty
must be punished though the heavens fall. Men,
stand aside!”</p>

<p>This was addressed to the two men who stood, one
on each side of the condemned bushranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>They obeyed the command of their chief, and he,
raising his revolver, pointed it at the breast of the
unhappy offender.</p>

<p>There was a moment of intense excitement, Harry
and Jack were spellbound.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by a sharp, explosive sound.
The deadly weapon had done its work; but it was not
the captive who had received the winged messenger of
death. It was the captain himself who staggered, and
with one convulsive movement fell prone to the earth.</p>

<p>The excitement among the bushrangers was intense.
Simultaneously they started forward, and
two of them, bending over, lifted the body of their
prostrate leader. But he was already dead.</p>

<p>Robert Graham, the man who had caused his
death, stood erect and unflinching.</p>

<p>He threw his weapon upon the ground, folded his
arms, and said, in a tone devoid of fear: “Comrades,
do with me what you will. I could not help doing
what I did. It was either my brother’s life or his.
Sandy was innocent of the crime charged against
him. Is there any one among you that would stand
by and see his brother murdered before his eyes
when he had the means of preventing it?”</p>

<p>The bushrangers looked at each other in doubt.
They had at first accepted the captain’s statement
that Sandy Graham was a traitor. His brother’s
explanation of his attempted desertion put a new
face on the matter. Then, again, there was not one
among them that had not tired of their despotic
leader. Alive, he had impressed them with fear,
but he was far from popular, and had no real friend
among them. It was a moment of doubt when a
leader was wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Well,” said Robert Graham, after a pause, “what
are you going to do with me? I wait your pleasure.”</p>

<p>“He ought to be served as he served the captain,”
said Fletcher, who disliked Graham.</p>

<p>“I say no,” rejoined Rupert Ring, a man of
medium height, but of great muscular development.
“It was a terrible deed, but had my brother been
in Sandy Graham’s shoes, I would have done the
same.”</p>

<p>There was a half murmur, which seemed like
approval.</p>

<p>“I move, therefore, that we pass over Robert
Graham’s deed as one to which he was impelled
by brotherly affection, and that we restore Sandy
Graham to his place in our ranks, on condition that
he does not repeat the offence. Those who agree
with me, hold up their right hands.”</p>

<p>All hands were raised except that of Fletcher.</p>

<p>“Release the prisoner,” said Ring, turning to the
two attendants.</p>

<p>Instantly the rope was cut, the dark cloth was
removed, and Sandy Graham, a tall, athletic, good-looking
fellow, stepped forth, his face pale from the
terrible strain to which he had been subjected.</p>

<p>“Comrades, brothers,” he said, in a voice indicating
deep emotion, “I thank you for giving me
back my life. It shall be devoted to your service.”</p>

<p>The first to press forward and grasp his hand
convulsively was his brother, Robert Graham.</p>

<p>“Robert,” said Sandy, “but for your brave act I
should have been lying dead instead of him,” and he
pointed, with a shudder, to the dead captain.</p>

<p>Their conversation was interrupted by Rupert
Ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Comrades,” he said, “the captain is dead. We
can do nothing without a leader. We should appoint
one at once.”</p>

<p>Here Fletcher pushed forward.</p>

<p>“I am the oldest in service among you,” he said.
“I was the trusted friend of Captain Stockton. I submit
that I have the best claim to be your leader.”</p>

<p>But among bushrangers, as in other communities,
the man who is the most anxious to secure office
is very apt to be left in the lurch. Now, it happened
that Fletcher was by no means a favourite in the
band. He was sly and sneaking in his methods,
currying favour with the captain, even at the expense
of manliness and self-respect, and there were
serious doubts as to his courage. If he had been
wiser, he would not have made a boast of his standing
with the late leader, for the men were heartily
tired of his tyranny, and resolved to elect some one
in his place who bore no similarity to him.</p>

<p>Rupert Ring smiled slightly as he heard Fletcher’s
modest claim.</p>

<p>“Comrades,” he said, “you have heard Fletcher’s
appeal. It is true that he is the oldest in service
among you. It is for you to consider whether that
entitles him to the post of leader. Those of you
who are in favour of Dick Fletcher as your leader
will signify it by raising your right hands.”</p>

<p>Fletcher’s eye wandered anxiously around the
circle. To his chagrin not a single hand was raised
save his own. There was a cheer of derision which
brought an angry flush to his cheek.</p>

<p>Then a clear voice was heard. It was that of
the young man, Wyman, whose conversation with
the two boys has already been recorded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“I nominate Rupert Ring for our leader,” he
said.</p>

<p>There was a chorus of approval, which emboldened
Wyman to add: “As he can’t very well
put the question on his own nomination, I will do
so. Those of you who want Ring for your captain,
please hold up your right hands.”</p>

<p>All hands were raised except that of Fletcher.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” said Wyman, who was unversed
in parliamentary language. “I call for three cheers
for Captain Ring!”</p>

<p>The woods echoed to the lusty cheers of the
bushrangers. It was evident, from the general expression
of satisfaction, that the choice was a popular
one.</p>

<p>“Comrades,” said the new captain modestly, “I
did not look for this promotion, as you may have
thought from my taking the lead just now, but I
saw that it was necessary for somebody to act. I
don’t know whether you have made a wise choice
or not, but I will do my best to make you think so.
Since I am your captain, it is my duty first to see
that proper honour is paid to the remains of your
late captain. Prepare a coffin, and at daybreak we
will commit him to the earth.”</p>

<p>“I would like to suggest,” said Fletcher, “that the
two boys”—here he turned in the direction where
Harry and Jack had been standing, and ejaculated
in dismay, “I don’t see them. What has become of
them?”</p>

<p>“They have taken advantage of the excitement
and confusion to run away, I fancy,” said the new
captain quietly.</p>

<p>This was quite true. Just after the fatal shot had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
been fired, and the attention of all had been taken up
by the tragedy, Harry had whispered to Jack, “Now’s
our time to escape, Jack. Follow me!”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” responded Jack promptly, and no
one noticed the two as they vanished among the trees.</p>

<p>“Shall I go after them, Captain Ring?” asked
Fletcher in excitement. “I’ll take another man,
and scour the woods for them.”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary,” said Ring indifferently.
“Let them go! They would only be in our way.”</p>

<p>“But,” protested Fletcher, “Captain Stockton meant
to take them into the band. They are bright and smart
boys, and would grow up into useful members.”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” said Ring earnestly. “Our
lives are spoiled already, and we have no chance
but to continue. Leave them to grow up innocent.”</p>

<p>“This is strange talk for a captain of bushrangers,”
said Fletcher, disappointed.</p>

<p>“Remember that I am your captain,” retorted
Ring sharply, “and don’t attempt to interfere with
me! Go, I would be alone.”</p>

<p>Fletcher slunk away, mortified and disappointed.
It was well for the two boys that he had not been
elected captain.</p>

<small>LOST IN THE WOODS</small></h2>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_072.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Y">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">Y</span>ES, the boys had escaped. When the excitement
produced by the fatal shot was
at its height, it had flashed upon Harry
like an inspiration that then, if ever, was
the time to escape. He knew that it would
be at the risk of their lives, and but for one consideration
it is doubtful if he would have been willing
to incur the peril of the attempt. But he felt that to
stay was to run a risk as great—that of being compelled
to join the ranks of the bushrangers, and of
that he had a great dread.</p>

<p>They never stopped running till they had set half
a mile between them and the camp of the bushrangers.
Jack was the first to show distress.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Harry,” he said, panting, “I’m all out
of breath.”</p>

<p>Harry instantly slackened his speed.</p>

<p>“Look back, Jack,” he said anxiously; “and see
if you can discover any one pursuing us.”</p>

<p>“I see no one,” answered Jack, after a prolonged
look.</p>

<p>“They have other things to think of,” said Harry.
“The murder of their captain has put all thoughts
of us out of their heads. When the excitement has
subsided a little, I am afraid they will look for us.
How terrible it was!” he added with a shudder.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Jack. “I saw that man—the
captive’s brother—lift his weapon and point it at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the captain. Almost before I could speak it was
discharged and the captain fell. He must have
been killed instantly.”</p>

<p>“I little thought what lay before me when I left
home,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew what lies before us now,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“I am afraid our prospects are rather dark. We
must take care at any rate not to fall again into the
hands of the bushrangers. I am most afraid of that
man Fletcher. If he could have his way, he would
show us no mercy.”</p>

<p>“Let us go on again,” said Jack. “I only stopped
to catch my breath.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Jack. The farther we get away
from the bushrangers the better.”</p>

<p>Before them was a densely wooded hill. The way
had become difficult with the scrub bushes that filled
up the distance between the trees.</p>

<p>“We can’t make our way here, Harry,” said Jack
despondently.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, we can. Besides, don’t you see, the
rougher and more difficult the way, the less are we
likely to be followed. I am willing to go through
a good deal to escape capture.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” answered Jack. “You are always
right. Push ahead, and I’ll follow.”</p>

<p>For three or four hours the boys kept on their
way. They surmounted the hill, and found a clearer
country. By this time it was growing dark, and the
boys were feeling both fatigued and hungry.</p>

<p>“I think we can rest now, Jack,” said Harry.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief Jack threw himself on the
ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“This is worse than any work I did on shipboard,”
he said.</p>

<p>Harry smiled.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is likely to cure you of your
love for the sea, Jack,” he said. “Though I haven’t
your fondness for sea life, I confess I would rather
be on the deck of a good staunch ship than here.”</p>

<p>“Harry,” said Jack anxiously, “when do you
think we shall find something to eat? I am terribly
hungry.”</p>

<p>“So am I, Jack. It’s the hard walk that has
increased our appetite.”</p>

<p>“I have often thought I might be afloat in an
open boat without anything to eat, but I never expected
to be caught in such a pickle on land.”</p>

<p>“A good many things have happened to us to-day
that we didn’t expect,” said Harry. “Do you
know, Jack, it seems the longest day I ever
spent!”</p>

<p>“I can say the same.”</p>

<p>“This morning we set out with Obed, free from
care. We have been captured by bushrangers,
taken to their camp, seen the murder of their
leader, escaped, and after walking for miles through
a rough wilderness here we are, tired out and in
danger of starvation.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say any more, Harry,” said Jack faintly.
“I can realise it without your description.”</p>

<p>“I wish Obed were with us,” said Harry, after a
pause. “Perhaps he could think of some way out
of our trouble. He is an experienced man, and is
used to roughing it. As for me, I feel helpless.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there is likely to be any house
near at hand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“It doesn’t look like it,” said Harry, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should mind much being caught
and carried back by the bushrangers, if they would
give me a good supper,” said Jack ruefully.</p>

<p>“Poor Jack!” said Harry compassionately; “I do
believe you are suffering for food.”</p>

<p>“I told you so, Harry.”</p>

<p>“My appetite no doubt will come later. At
present I am not very uncomfortable. Well, Jack,
there is only one thing to do. We must explore
farther and see if we can find any trace of a human
habitation. Suppose you go to yonder knoll, and
climb the tree at the top. Then use your eyes for
all they are worth.”</p>

<p>Jack followed his advice, and with a sailor’s agility
mounted the tree. Then, shading his eyes with his
hand, he looked earnestly, first in one direction, then
in another.</p>

<p>“Well, Jack?” inquired Harry anxiously.</p>

<p>There was a pause; then Jack called out joyfully:
“I see a light: yes, I am sure I see a light.”</p>

<p>“Whereaway?”</p>

<p>“Straight ahead, or a little to the left.”</p>

<p>“Take a good look, Jack, so as to be sure of your
bearings. Then we will make our way toward it
with the best speed we can muster.”</p>

<p>Jack scrambled down from the tree with his face
actually cheerful. The prospect of a meal had put
new life into him.</p>

<p>“Follow me!” he said. “I don’t think it can be
more than a mile away.”</p>

<p>Not feeling their fatigue so much now that they
were buoyed up by the hope of shelter and food,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
the two boys plodded on. The way was at times
difficult, and there was no glimpse of the light which
Jack had seen from the tree-top.</p>

<p>“Do you think you are on the right track, Jack?”
asked Harry anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, I feel sure of it,” answered the young
sailor.</p>

<p>Events proved that Jack was right. They came
to an open place, from which they could distinctly
see the light gleaming from a dwelling.</p>

<p>“There, what did I tell you?” demanded Jack
triumphantly.</p>

<p>“You are right, Jack. I am glad enough to admit
it. Now the question is, will the people who occupy
the house let us in?”</p>

<p>“They can’t be so inhuman as to refuse. Pass
on, Harry.”</p>

<p>They were not long in reaching the hut. It was
one of those slab huts which are used by shepherds.
They are lonely enough, the stations being in some
instances twenty miles from the nearest dwelling.
This was a single dwelling, the home of one of the
outkeepers. The chief stations are usually an
aggregation of dwellings. In the yard was a pile of
wood for fuel. Close at hand was a paddock surrounded
by a rail fence, over which hung a number
of sheepskins. All these evidences of habitation
cheered the hearts of the lonely boys.</p>

<p>Harry went up to the door and knocked.</p>

<p>His knock appeared to create some commotion
inside. A voice was heard, and then there was
audible the barking of a dog, but no one came to
the door.</p>

<p>“Suppose you knock again, Harry,” said Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“They must have heard my first knock. Perhaps
they don’t want to let us in.”</p>

<p>However, Harry knocked again.</p>

<p>Again the dog inside barked, this time with fierce
emphasis.</p>

<p>“Is there no one inside but the dog?” thought
Harry anxiously. Having no weapon with him, he
took a piece of a broken rail, so that in case of
necessity he might have a means of defence.</p>

<p>He was about to venture on a third knock when
a tremulous voice, which the boys at once recognised
as that of a girl, was heard from within.</p>

<p>“Who are you? What do you want?”</p>

<p>“We are two boys who have lost our way, and
are almost starved,” answered Harry. “For heaven’s
sake let us in, and give us something to eat.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, the girl being evidently undecided.</p>

<p>“Are there only two of you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Only two.”</p>

<p>“You are sure there is no one with you?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“And you are boys?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What brings you here—in this lonely place, at
this hour?”</p>

<p>“We are on our way to the goldfields of Bendigo.”</p>

<p>“But this is off the road.”</p>

<p>“I know it. The fact is, we were captured by
the bushrangers, and have made our escape. We
plunged into the woods, thinking we were less likely
to be caught and carried back.”</p>

<p>There was a change in the girl’s tone as she said
“Is this really true? Are you not bushrangers yourselves?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“No, I hope not,” answered Harry, with a boyish
laugh.</p>

<p>This laugh, which sounded natural and genuine,
evidently inspired the girl with confidence.</p>

<p>“If I let you in, will you promise to do no mischief?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“You shall have no cause to regret admitting us,
we promise that.”</p>

<p>There was still a little pause of indecision, and
then a bolt was drawn, and the door opened. The
two boys saw in the doorway a pleasant-faced girl of
fourteen, whose eyes fell upon them not without a
shade of anxiety. But when she saw that the two
visitors were boys not much older than herself, there
was a look of relief, and she said, “I will trust you.
Come in if you like. Hush, Bruno!”</p>

<p>This was addressed to a large shepherd dog that
stood beside her, eyeing them suspiciously.</p>

<p>A weight seemed lifted from the hearts of the two
boys as they caught sight of the comfortable interior
of the hut. On the one side of the room was a large
open fireplace, on which a good fire was burning.
The flickering flames helped illumine the apartment,
and diffused a home-like air, which was most grateful
to the two tired wanderers.</p>

<p>“You are very kind to admit us,” said Harry.
“You have no idea how great a favour it is.”</p>

<p>“I would have let you in before, but I thought you
might be bushrangers,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“We don’t look much like bushrangers, do we?”
said Harry, with a smile.</p>

<p>The girl smiled too. She was evidently pleased
with the appearance of her two visitors.</p>

<p>“No; if I had seen you I should have known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
better than to think you belonged to their band.
Come in and sit down by the fire.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Harry and Jack seated themselves on a settle
near the fire, and the girl continued to eye them
curiously.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are boys,” she said.</p>

<p>“We don’t call ourselves men yet,” answered
Harry.</p>

<p>“I never saw a boy before,” was the unexpected
remark of their young hostess.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span>!” ejaculated the two boys in concert.</p>

<p>“I scarcely ever saw anybody,” explained the girl.
“My father and I live here alone, and have lived
here for years. He has a flock of fifteen hundred
sheep to watch and tend. Sometimes another shepherd
calls here, and we had a visit from the bushrangers
last year.”</p>

<p>“It must be very lonely for you,” said Harry, in a
sympathetic tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is; but I am used to it. Father is away
all day, but he leaves Bruno to keep me company.”</p>

<p>“Come here, Bruno!” said Jack, in a coaxing
tone.</p>

<p>Bruno eyed Jack dubiously, and finally walked
up to him deliberately, and allowed himself to be
stroked.</p>

<p>“Bruno doesn’t think we are bushrangers,” said
Jack, smiling.</p>

<p>“He did at first though,” the girl replied, with an
answering smile. “Have you been walking all
day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the greater part of the day.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be hungry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“We are almost starved!” said Harry tragically.
“Are we not, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I am quite starved,” said the young sailor.</p>

<p>“Then I must get you some supper,” said the girl,
in a hospitable tone.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Harry earnestly. “Will you
let me know your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“My name is Lucy.”</p>

<p>“My grandmother’s name was Lucy,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Then you may look upon me as your grandmother,”
said the girl demurely.</p>

<p>Of course all three laughed heartily at this absurdity.
Then Lucy moved about with quick steps,
and soon a goodly supper of mutton-chops was fizzling
in the frying-pan, sending forth savoury odours
that made their mouths water. Presently Lucy
drew out a table, and placed upon it the chops and
some bread.</p>

<p>“I would boil some potatoes,” she said, “but you
might not like to wait so long.”</p>

<p>“I think we won’t wait, Lucy.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me your name,” said Lucy, as
they drew up to the table.</p>

<p>“My name is Harry Vane,” said the possessor of
that name.</p>

<p>“And mine is Jack Pendleton.”</p>

<p>“Harry and Jack,” repeated Lucy, nodding.</p>

<p>At this point Bruno raised his head, looked toward
the door, and began to bark.</p>

<p>“I think my father must be close by,” said Lucy.
“Bruno is always the first to hear him.”</p>

<p>Before Lucy could reach the door it was opened,
and a stalwart man of middle age paused on the
threshold in evident surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Whom have you here, Lucy?” he asked, in a
tone of displeasure.</p>

<p>“Two boys, papa, who came here in distress,
having lost their way.”</p>

<p>“Did I not caution you against admitting
strangers?” continued her father, with a slight
frown.</p>

<p>“Yes, but these are boys, not men.”</p>

<p>Harry Vane thought it was time to start.</p>

<p>“I hope, sir,” he said, “you won’t blame your
daughter for her kindness to us. We stood greatly
in need of friendly help, having been robbed of
everything by the bushrangers, from whom we
managed to escape some hours since.”</p>

<p>The shepherd regarded Harry keenly, and proceeded
to cross-examine him.</p>

<p>“You say you were captured by the bushrangers,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“When was this?”</p>

<p>“This morning, just after breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Where did it happen?”</p>

<p>Harry told him.</p>

<p>“Where were you going?”</p>

<p>“To the mines at Bendigo.”</p>

<p>“How large was your party?”</p>

<p>“There were only three of us—a countryman of
ours and ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“The bushrangers robbed him and let him go.”</p>

<p>“Why did they not release you and your friend?”</p>

<p>“Because, as a young member of the band told us,
the captain meant to spare us to join the band.”</p>

<p>“You are young to be travelling to the mines.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Humph! your story sounds well enough, but how do
I know that you are not spies of the bushrangers?”</p>

<p>Harry Vane’s eyes flashed indignantly.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t think so badly of us,” he said.</p>

<p>The shepherd seemed somewhat impressed by his
indignant denial, which certainly seemed genuine
enough, but wanted information on one point.</p>

<p>“How did you manage to escape? That doesn’t
seem very probable, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“We both took advantage of the excitement occasioned
by the murder of Captain Stockton——” he
began.</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the shepherd, in profound astonishment.
“Captain Stockton murdered! When?
By whom?”</p>

<p>Of course Harry told the story, but that need not
be repeated.</p>

<p>The shepherd listened in evident excitement.</p>

<p>“If this is true,” he said, “nothing better could
have happened for this part of Australia. This
man—Stockton—is noted everywhere as the most
desperate and cruel of the bushrangers. I can’t
begin to tell you how many atrocious crimes he has
committed. He killed my brother in cold blood three
years since”—here the shepherd’s face darkened—“because
he defended the property of another, and
tried to save it from being stolen. If he is dead I
am deeply, profoundly grateful!”</p>

<p>“You need have no doubt on that point, sir,” said
Harry. “Jack and myself saw him shot down. There
can be no doubt of his death.”</p>

<p>“I believe you speak the truth. You don’t look
as if you were deceiving me. So you took the opportunity
to give the bushrangers legbail, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“We didn’t stay to bid them good-bye,” said Harry,
smiling. “We ran till we were out of breath, but
saw no one on our track. Probably it was some
time before we were thought of and our escape
noticed. We have been walking ever since, and
were ready to drop with hunger and fatigue when
we espied your cottage, and ventured to ask for help.”</p>

<p>“You are welcome to all that we can do for you,”
said the shepherd, his tone changing. “I was suspicious
at first, for the bushrangers are up to all sorts
of tricks, but the news you have brought insures you
a welcome. At last my poor brother is avenged, and
the bloodthirsty villain who killed him has gone to
his account. You don’t know who is elected in his
place?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, we came away at once.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course; I should have thought of
that.”</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t Fletcher,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Ha! what do you know of Dick Fletcher?”</p>

<p>“More than we want to. He it was who passed
himself off on us as a returned miner, and betrayed
us into the hands of his comrades.”</p>

<p>“I know of him, too. He would be as bad as the
captain if he dared, but he is a coward. His turn will
come after a while. But, Lucy”—here he addressed
his daughter—“you are not treating your guests very
well. Where are your potatoes and other vegetables?”</p>

<p>“They were so hungry they preferred not to wait
for them, papa.”</p>

<p>“You may put them in the pot now. I want them,
and I think our young friends will be able to eat
them later.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“You are very kind, sir, but I am afraid Jack and
I will not be able to compensate you. The bushrangers
took all we had, and left us penniless.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want your money, boy. You are welcome
to all you get in this house. We don’t have visitors
very often. When they do come, they have no bills
to pay.”</p>

<p>“Unless they are bushrangers, father!” said Lucy,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“If they are bushrangers they will meet with a
still warmer reception. And now, daughter,” said
the shepherd, “hurry up supper, for I have a very
fair appetite myself.”</p>

<p>Lucy moved about quietly but actively in obedience
to her father’s directions. An hour later, or
perhaps less, the table was spread once more, and
all got up to it. The boys, though the edge of their
appetite was taken away, managed to eat the vegetables
with a relish, not having had a chance to eat
any for a considerable time.</p>

<p>After supper they sat down beside the fire and
talked. Living so much alone, the shepherd and his
daughter were anxious to hear all that the boys could
tell them of the great world from which they lived
aloof. Later in the evening, the shepherd, whose
name, by the way, was Andrew Campbell, said, “Now,
let us have a little music. Lucy, bring me the bagpipe.”</p>

<p>His daughter went into an adjoining room, and
brought out a Highland bagpipe, which Campbell
received, and straightway began to play upon it some
characteristic Scotch tunes. It was loud and harsh,
but the boys enjoyed it for want of better.</p>

<p>“Don’t you sing, Miss Lucy?” asked Harry, when
her father laid down the instrument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“No,” answered the girl, smiling. “I wish I did.
Father is very fond of singing.”</p>

<p>“Aye, am I; Lucy’s mother sang, but the gift has
not descended to her.”</p>

<p>“Harry is a professional singer,” said Jack. “He
sings in public.”</p>

<p>“Please sing something, then,” pleaded Lucy.</p>

<p>“If you really wish it,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to hear you, young sir,” said the
shepherd.</p>

<p>Harry hesitated no longer, but sang at once,
choosing such Scotch melodies as he knew in preference.
The shepherd’s eyes glistened, and he was
evidently much moved.</p>

<p>“It calls back my early days, when as a lad I trod
the heath in Scotland,” he said. “You are a fine
singer. I don’t mind when I have enjoyed an evening
as much.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad, sir, if I have been able in this
way to repay your kindness,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of it, lad,” said the shepherd, lapsing
into his Scotch mode of speech. “We shan’t miss
the bit sup we have given you.”</p>

<p>At nine o’clock all retired for the night, for the
shepherd must be up early in the morning to look
after his flocks. Harry and Jack slept in a small
room at the back. They were very tired, and fell
asleep as soon as their heads struck the pillow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>A DANGEROUS ACQUAINTANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_086.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="T">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HOUGH the boys were very much
fatigued, they were up in time for an
early breakfast the next morning. It
consisted of mutton-chops, potatoes,
bread, and coffee, and they were prepared,
notwithstanding their hearty supper of the
night before, to do full justice to it.</p>

<p>The shepherd had got over his first impression,
and nothing could be more friendly than his manner
toward them. He gave a still stronger proof of his
confidence and friendship.</p>

<p>“So you think of going to the mines, my lads,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about the wisdom of your plans.
It isn’t all that find the gold they look for. Are you
expecting to come back with fortunes?”</p>

<p>“They would not be unwelcome, sir,” said Harry,
“but we shall at any rate like the advantage of it,
and we are young enough to try experiments.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; but about the gold I’m thinkin’
you’ll be disappointed. At any rate I’ll make you
an offer—the two of you. Stay here and help me
tend sheep. I’ll give you your living and clothes,
and when you are twenty-one, I will make you a
present of a hundred sheep each to start in business
for yourselves.”</p>

<p>The proposal took Harry and Jack by surprise.
They could not but observe that Lucy’s face brightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
with hope as she awaited their answer. It was
clear that she hoped it would be favourable. It must
be acknowledged that this made a considerable impression
upon them. Lucy was a pretty girl, and they
felt flattered by her desire that they should remain.
But their resolution was only shaken, not changed.
They had but to look about them at the unbroken
solitude to feel that life under such circumstances
would be unendurable. Both of them had led lives
of activity and excitement, and neither felt prepared
to settle down, but they felt grateful.</p>

<p>“Jack and I thank you for your kindness, Mr.
Campbell,” said Harry, “and consider your offer a
good one. But it would be lonely for us here, and,
though we may change our minds, we would like to
try the goldfields first.”</p>

<p>“It’s only natural, lads,” said the shepherd. “You
are young, and you crave excitement. When you
are as old as I am, you won’t mind the quiet. But
if you have bad luck at Bendigo come back here,
and you shall be welcome to stay as long as you
like, and to accept my offer if you feel like it then.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry you won’t stay,” said Lucy, with a
shade of sadness.</p>

<p>“I wish we could be contented to do so,” said
Harry. “You may be sure we won’t forget your
kindness, Miss Campbell.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean me?” asked Lucy, smiling. “I
never was called Miss Campbell before.”</p>

<p>“I will say Lucy, if you will allow me.”</p>

<p>“I would rather you did.”</p>

<p>“Then good-bye, Lucy. We shall always remember
you.”</p>

<p>“And you will come back some day?”</p>

<p>“If we can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Then good-bye, and don’t forget your promise.”</p>

<p>There was a suspicious moisture in the girl’s eyes,
for she knew that when the young visitors were gone
she would feel lonelier than ever.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice girl, Jack,” said Harry, after a pause.</p>

<p>“That’s so, Harry. I never saw a girl so nice
before,” responded Jack emphatically.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Jack,” said Harry, turning to him
with a smile, “it is just as well we are going away.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Harry?”</p>

<p>“If we stayed here till we were both young men,
we might both fall in love with Lucy, and quarrel
over her.”</p>

<p>“I might fall in love with her, but I would never
quarrel with you, Harry,” said Jack affectionately.</p>

<p>“No, Jack, I don’t think you would. Nothing
shall ever divide us.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind to a poor sailor boy,” said
Jack. “You know a great deal more than I, and I
am not fit to be your friend.”</p>

<p>“Take care, Jack, I may quarrel with you if you
say anything against yourself. Fit or unfit, you are
my chosen friend, and I should not be willing to
exchange you for any one else I have ever met.”</p>

<p>The boys did not set out on their journey empty
handed. Lucy, by direction of her father, had packed
a basket with provisions enough to last them two or
three days. The shepherd wished also to lend them
some money, but this Harry declined.</p>

<p>“We might not be able to pay it back,” he said.</p>

<p>“I shan’t miss it, lads, if you don’t,” urged the
shepherd.</p>

<p>“We might be robbed of it as we were of our other
money, sir. We thank you all the same.”</p>

<p>But they gladly accepted the basket of provisions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
without which, indeed, they might have fared badly
in that uninhabited wilderness.</p>

<p>“How far is it to Bendigo?” Harry had asked the
shepherd.</p>

<p>“Twenty miles or thereabouts,” was the answer.
“You will be fortunate, however, if you reach there
in three or four days.”</p>

<p>“If it were a straight road and good travelling we
might be there by night. Give us the direction, and
we will try it, sir.”</p>

<p>The two young travellers, refreshed by their
night’s sleep and two substantial meals, made good
progress, and by noon found themselves, despite
the difficulties of the way, seven miles distant from
the station where they had received such hospitable
treatment. By this time they were hungry, and
were glad to sit down at the base of a gigantic
gum-tree and attack the provisions they had
brought with them. They were in good spirits
and chatted cheerfully. Many thousands of miles
away from home, without a penny in their pockets,
and with only a basket of provisions between them
and starvation, they did not allow themselves to be
depressed by their uncertain prospects, but looked
forward hopefully.</p>

<p>“Jack,” said Harry, “it seems so lonely here, I
could easily believe that we two are alone in the world.”</p>

<p>“It does seem so,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“I feel a little like Robinson Crusoe on his island.”</p>

<p>“Am I to be Friday?” asked Jack, with a smile.</p>

<p>Jack had read very few books, but who is there
who has not read Robinson Crusoe?</p>

<p>“I don’t think you are of the right colour, Jack, but
I would a good deal rather have you than Friday.”</p>

<p>They were not so far away from human companionship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
as they supposed, as they soon learned
to their dismay. Suddenly they heard a crunching
as of steps upon the brush, and turning, they saw,
with alarm, a tall muscular man, with matted locks
unprotected by a hat, a long untrimmed beard, and
a suit hanging in tatters over his gaunt, bony figure.
His eyes were fixed with a famished look upon the
open basket of provisions.</p>

<p>The boys started to their feet in affright.</p>

<p>“Give me food!” said the stranger, in a hoarse
voice.</p>

<p>Harry took some bread and meat from the basket
and handed them to the stranger, who devoured
them in silence. His appetite seemed enormous,
and the boys saw in dismay that if he kept on
there would be very little left. It was necessary in
self-defence to limit the man’s rapacity.</p>

<p>“More, more!” he cried, when he had eaten all
that had been given him.</p>

<p>“We have given you all we can spare,” said Harry
firmly.</p>

<p>“Give me the basket, or I will kill you both!”
exclaimed the tramp, his eyes suffused with blood,
and gleaming with fierce anger.</p>

<p>As he spoke he raised a knotted stick which
had served him as a cane, and swung it menacingly
above his head.</p>

<p>Harry and Jack were brave boys, and not easily
daunted, but the attitude of the stranger was so
menacing, and his frame so indicative of strength,
that they were both alarmed. Had their need of
the provisions been less urgent they would have
surrendered them without a struggle, but they felt
that it was a question possibly of continued life or
starvation, and this inspired them to resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Holding the basket in his hand, Harry retreated
behind a tree, and began to parley.</p>

<p>“You are asking too much,” he said. “We have
given you a meal. We need the rest for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“No palavering, boy!” said the tramp roughly.
“I need it more than you do. Give it to me, or I
will kill you.”</p>

<p>“If I only had some weapon,” thought Harry.</p>

<p>While he was hesitating, the tramp, with a quick
movement, sprang to where he stood, clutched him
by the collar, and flinging him on his back put his
knee on his breast, saying between his closed teeth,
“Now I will kill you, young jackanapes! I’ll teach
you to interfere with me.”</p>

<p>Poor Harry thought his last moment had come.
He was powerless against his enemy, whose wild
rage, shown in his distorted features, seemed capable
of anything. His sole helper was Jack, who flung
himself on the giant, and sought with his boyish
strength to pull him away, but in vain.</p>

<p>“I’ll choke the life out of you, you young beast!”
exclaimed the tramp, preparing to clutch Harry by the
throat. The moment was a critical one for the poor
boy, whose career came near ending then and there.</p>

<p>But assistance came when least expected.</p>

<p>A man who had approached, unseen by either of
the three, jumped from the underbrush, and with
one powerful blow sent the tramp sprawling on the
ground beside his intended victim.</p>

<p>“You’re rather out of your reckoning, you mean
skunk!” he exclaimed. “If there’s any killin’ to be
done round here, I’m goin’ to do it.”</p>

<p>“Obed Stackpole!” ejaculated the boys in heart-felt
delight, and they were rushing forward to greet
him, but he waved them back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Yes,” he said, “it’s Obed himself. I’ll talk to
you in a minute, after I’ve got through with this
consarned villain.”</p>

<p>By this time the tramp, though startled and dazed,
was on his feet, and preparing to make a desperate
assault on the Yankee. But though quite as strong,
and possibly stronger than Obed Stackpole, he had
now to encounter a foe by no means to be despised.
Moreover, he had laid down his knotted stick, and
Obed had secured it. It was a formidable weapon,
and Mr. Stackpole was quite ready to make use of it.</p>

<p>“Give me my stick!” shouted the tramp hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I mean to,” responded the Yankee coolly. “Where
will you have it?”</p>

<p>He stepped back warily, as the other advanced,
holding the stick in a strong grasp, while he kept his
eyes steadily fixed on his opponent. He was cool, but
his enemy was enraged, and rage made him incautious.</p>

<p>He made a desperate clutch at the stick, but with a
powerful sweep Obed struck him on the side of the
head, and he fell like an ox, stunned and insensible.</p>

<p>“That settles you, my friend, I guess,” said Obed.
“You brought it upon yourself, and you’ve got no
one else to blame. Watch him, Harry, to see that he
doesn’t come to himself, while I tie his hands.”</p>

<p>Obed whipped a strong cord from his pockets,
and secured the wrists of the prostrate enemy, tying
them securely together.</p>

<p>“Will you tie his feet, too?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“No, it is not necessary. He can’t do any harm
now. I came in the nick of time, boys, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Indeed you did!” said Harry earnestly. “He
was beginning to choke me.”</p>

<p>“What was it all about?”</p>

<p>“We had given him a meal, but he wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
make off with the basket besides. As this would
have left us utterly without food, I objected.”</p>

<p>“The mean skunk! I’m glad I came up in time
to settle him.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you have something to eat yourself, Mr.
Stackpole?” asked Harry, bethinking himself that
his deliverer might need refreshment.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind if I do,” answered Obed. “The fact
is, I’m feeling kinder hollow. I feel a gnawin’ at my
vitals that isn’t pleasant. This is prime fodder;
where did you raise it?”</p>

<p>While Obed was eating—with hearty relish, it may
be added—Harry related briefly what had befallen
Jack and himself since they had parted company.</p>

<p>“You’re in luck, boys,” was Obed’s comment.
“You fared better than I, for you’ve had your
square meals, while I’ve had only one besides this.”</p>

<p>“Where was that?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“At the same place where you passed the night.
I got there about an hour after you left, as well as
I can make out. The gal was very kind, and gave
me a tip-top breakfast. I ate till I was ashamed,
and then left off hungry. That’s why I’ve got such
an appetite now. Yesterday I didn’t have but one
meal, and I’ve had to make up for that.”</p>

<p>“Did Lucy tell you we had passed the night at
her father’s house?”</p>

<p>“Lucy! Seems to me you got mighty familiar,”
said Obed, in a jocular tone. “She didn’t tell me
what her name was. I suppose she looked upon me
as a dried-up old bach.”</p>

<p>“She’s a nice girl,” said Harry emphatically.</p>

<p>“So she is. I’m with you there. But about your
question—I asked her if she had seen anything of two
chaps about your size, and she told me enough to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
me I was on your track. She told me which way you
went, and I follered. She was a little shy at first,
not knowin’ but I might be an enemy of yours, but
when she’d made up her mind to the <i>contrary</i> she
up and told me everything. Well, I struck your
trail, and here I am.”</p>

<p>“I for one am delighted to see you, Obed,” said
Harry cordially.</p>

<p>“And I for two,” added Jack, smiling.</p>

<p>Mr. Stackpole seemed gratified by the pleasure
evinced by the boys.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “we’re together once more, and
now we must hold a council of war, and decide what’s
to be done.”</p>

<p>“With him?” asked Jack, pointing to the tramp.</p>

<p>“With him first of all; I take it you don’t want me
to invite him to join our party?”</p>

<p>“His room is better than his company,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“I agree with you. According to my idea, we
may as well leave him where he lies.”</p>

<p>“But won’t he starve?”</p>

<p>“He can get his hands free after awhile,” said
Obed, “but not till after we are at a safe distance.
You needn’t be afraid about him. Anyhow the world
wouldn’t lose much if he did take passage for another.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Obed, but I wouldn’t like to feel that
we were responsible for his death.”</p>

<p>At this moment the prostrate man opened his
eyes, and as his glance lighted on Obed, they gleamed
with the old look of rage. He tried to get up, and
of course discovered that his hands were tied.</p>

<p>“Loosen my hands, you scoundrel!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“If you mean me by that pet name, my esteemed
friend,” said Obed, “I respectfully decline. I’d rather
look at you with your hands tied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Do you want me to kill you?” demanded the
tramp furiously.</p>

<p>“Not at present! when I do I’ll let you know.
Come, boys, we may as well be going. This gentleman
would rather be left alone.”</p>

<p>“Unloose me first, and I won’t harm you,” said the
other, trying to struggle to his feet.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean you shall. Good-bye, my friend.
I can’t say I wish to meet you again. I will take the
liberty to carry off your stick, as you won’t need it
with your hands tied.”</p>

<p>Obed and the boys started off, followed by the
most fearful execrations from their late acquaintance.
They had scarcely gone a quarter of a mile when
they met two mounted police, who halted their
horses and inquired: “Have you seen anything of a
man, tall and spare, dark hair and eyes. We have
traced him to this neighbourhood, and think he must
be near.”</p>

<p>“What has he done?” asked Obed curiously.</p>

<p>“Murdered a man at the mines in a drunken
brawl.”</p>

<p>“We’ve just parted company with him,” said
Obed. “I found him experimentin’ on my young
friend here, but come up in time to block his game.”</p>

<p>“Put us on his track, and we will share the reward
of a hundred pounds with you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it. Boys, stay here and I’ll go back with
these gentlemen. I’ll join you in an hour.”</p>

<p>Obed was as good as his word. Within an hour
he was back again, with the two policemen, followed
by the man whom we have called the tramp.</p>

<p>His hands were more securely fastened now by
a pair of handcuffs.</p>

<small>THE BOYS ARRIVE AT BENDIGO</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap2" src="images/i_096.jpg" width="91" height="75" alt="“Y">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">“Y</span>OU are entitled to half the reward offered
for the apprehension of this man,” said
the leader of the police to Obed Stackpole.
“I congratulate you. Fifty pounds
is a sum not to be despised.”</p>

<p>“Especially when a man has been robbed of all
he possesses by bushrangers,” said Obed. “If you’ll
excuse me, captain, why does your government allow
them rascals to roam round the country, plundering
and killing honest men?”</p>

<p>The captain of police shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“We can’t help it, my good man. We do all we
can,” he answered.</p>

<p>“In my country we would soon put a stop
to it.”</p>

<p>“You mean America?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the land of the Stars and the Stripes,” said
Obed proudly.</p>

<p>“It is more difficult here,” observed the police
captain. “The nature of the country makes pursuit
difficult. Besides, we have had so many convicts
sent out here in past years that there is a large
proportion of lawless men in the colony. Some of
these men have made themselves very formidable.
There is Captain Stockton, for instance.”</p>

<p>“<i>Was</i>, you mean, captain.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p>“Captain Stockton is dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Do you mean this? How do you know?” inquired
the captain of police eagerly.</p>

<p>“He was killed yesterday by one of his men.”</p>

<p>“What evidence have you of this?” demanded the
captain incredulously.</p>

<p>“Them two boys saw him shot,” said Obed, indicating
Harry and Jack.</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it, young man,” said the captain
to Harry. “It will be good news at Bendigo. Returning
miners are always in fear of this famous
bushranger, Stockton. He doesn’t care so much
to attack parties bound to the mines, for they are
not supposed to have much with them, but those
returning to Melbourne generally carry more or less
gold, and are worth capturing.”</p>

<p>Harry gave a succinct account of his adventures
while in the power of the bushrangers, and the scene
of which he had been a witness. The captain of
police listened attentively.</p>

<p>“This is good news,” he remarked. “There will
be a new captain appointed, of course, but there is
not another man connected with the gang who can
take Stockton’s place or do as much mischief as he
has done.”</p>

<p>“How far are we from Bendigo, captain?” asked
Obed.</p>

<p>“Two days’ journey, or perhaps more.”</p>

<p>“A long distance, considering we have no money.”</p>

<p>“You will have half the reward. Your share will
be fifty pounds.”</p>

<p>“That won’t do us any good now, unless you’ll
be kind enough to advance us a part of that sum.”</p>

<p>“I would if I were able, but I am not provided
with any money beyond what I need. You and the
boys may come with us, however, if you wish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“I should like nothing better, captain. Once at
Bendigo, and we’ll manage to shift for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Very well, so let it be.”</p>

<p>I pass over the events of the next two days. Obed
and the boys, after all their troubles, found themselves
provided with an official escort, and on the
morning of the third day arrived at the famous
goldfields of Bendigo.</p>

<p>Ballarat and Mount Alexander preceded Bendigo
in point of time, but Bendigo has been far more
productive. As the little party descended a hill
made white by the sandy dirt thrown out of the
mines, they saw below them Bendigo Creek, yellow
as the Tiber, running sluggishly through the valley,
which on either side had been dug up by prospectors
for gold. All about on the slopes of the hills and
in the valley were rude huts, hastily put together,
the homes of the miners. Some of them were built
of solid trunks of trees laid horizontally, after
the backwoods order of architecture. The interstices
were generally daubed with clay to make
them water-tight, and the roofs were covered with
sheets of bark, kept down by logs laid upon them.
There were tents also, made of slabs, and covered
with canvas. Still others were covered with bullock
hides.</p>

<p>To Harry and Jack the sight was a novel one,
and they regarded the extemporised village with
interest.</p>

<p>Obed’s eyes glistened, and he rubbed his hands
with delight.</p>

<p>“This seems like home,” he said. “It’s just like
Shantytown in Californy, where I worked three
months last year. I say, boys, how do you like it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“I shouldn’t like to live here very long,” said
Harry.</p>

<p>“I like shipboard better,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“I agree with you, boys,” said Obed, “but it’ll suit
me well enough if I can find enough gold here.
When I’ve made my pile, Australy won’t hold me
long. I shall make tracks for home.”</p>

<p>“But you have Indians,” retorted the police
captain, who did not quite relish the strictures
upon the colony of which he was an official. “I
would rather be captured by a bushranger than
scalped by an Indian.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, captain, but the Indians won’t
scalp you unless you go where they are. I never
saw one till I was past twenty-one.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the captain, in evident surprise.
“I thought they were all over the country. Why,
one of your countrymen told me they would sometimes
surprise families within ten miles of your
great city of New York, and scalp them all. He
said he was brought up—raised, he called it—twenty
miles away, and was obliged to barricade
the doors and windows every night, and keep a
supply of loaded muskets by the side of his bed,
to resist the Indians in case they made a night
attack.”</p>

<p>Obed laughed till the tears came to his eyes, and
the two boys also looked amused.</p>

<p>“Did you believe all this, captain?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the captain, looking offended.
“My informant was a countryman of yours.”</p>

<p>“He was stuffing you, captain.”</p>

<p>“<i>Stuffing</i> me! I don’t understand,” said the captain,
puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“He saw that you knew very little of America,
and he practised a little on your credulity—isn’t
that the word?”</p>

<p>“How do I know but you are doing the same
now? Probably you want to give me a favourable
idea of your country.”</p>

<p>“I only want you to judge it correctly, captain.
Why, there ain’t no more danger of being scalped
in New York than in London.”</p>

<p>“I presume not, <i>in</i> New York, but I am speaking
of the neighbourhood of New York.”</p>

<p>“So am I. I’ll tell you what, captain, if you can
find me a case of a man that’s been scalped within
five hundred miles of New York within the last
fifty years, I’ll give you my share of the reward. Of
course if it’s in Canada, it don’t count.”</p>

<p>“I can’t accept any such wager. I have no means
of proving it, even if it is so.”</p>

<p>By this time they had descended the hill, and
were on the borders of the mining settlement. They
had now attracted the attention of the miners, and
when the prisoner was recognised there went up an
angry shout, and a band of swarthy, bearded men
advanced menacingly to meet them.</p>

<p>“Give him to us!” they cried. “Give up the
murderer! We will make short work of him!”</p>

<p>The face of the prisoner, as he met the angry
glances of the miners, betrayed extreme fear. In
spite of his terrible crime, Harry could not help
pitying him when he saw the grey pallor that overspread
his countenance.</p>

<p>The captain of the police was a brave and determined
man, and, though his little force was outnumbered
five to one, he showed no signs of yielding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“What is it you want, men?” he demanded
sternly.</p>

<p>“We want that man—the murderer,” was the
unanimous cry.</p>

<p>“What would you do with him?”</p>

<p>“String him up to the nearest tree,” replied a
brawny miner.</p>

<p>“There is no occasion for you to punish him—he
is in the hands of the law,” replied the captain.</p>

<p>“He may escape. We want to make sure of him.”</p>

<p>“I will answer for it that he does not escape.
You know me, and you can accept my assurance.
Is that satisfactory?”</p>

<p>There was a sullen murmur among the miners.
It was evident that they were not wholly satisfied.</p>

<p>The captain of police watched them keenly, and
saw that there was danger of an attack.</p>

<p>He drew a pistol, and holding it firmly in his
hand, said: “The first man that interferes with me
in the discharge of my duty, dies. I give you fair
warning.”</p>

<p>A determined man generally carries his point,
even against odds. Had the captain showed the
slightest sign of wavering, the mob would have
been upon him. But they saw that he was in
earnest, and meant what he said.</p>

<p>“How long is he to live?” asked the brawny
miner already referred to, after a slight pause.</p>

<p>“I shall take him before the magistrate at once,
and you know he is not likely to defer punishment.”</p>

<p>The police magistrate who dispensed justice, and
frequently injustice, at Bendigo, was noted for his
severity, and this assurance seemed to satisfy the
miners. They followed the cavalcade, however, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
make sure that the captain kept his word. It may
be stated here that, at this early period in the
history of the colony, the judicial forms which prevail
in other countries were for the most part dispensed
with, and punishment was swift and certain,
especially where life or property had been attacked.</p>

<p>Harry and Jack followed the crowd to a wooden
structure more pretentious than most of the buildings
roundabout. The magistrate—whom I will call
Judge Wood—was at hand. He was a short, stout
man of severe aspect, and had a harsh voice.</p>

<p>“Whom have we here?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>The captain of police answered the question,
relating also where and under what circumstances
the capture was made.</p>

<p>“What have you to say for yourself, my man?” he
asked, turning to the prisoner.</p>

<p>“I am innocent,” was the reply, in trembling accents.</p>

<p>“Of course. You all are. I never had a man
brought before me who was not innocent,” said the
magistrate, with a sneer. “Have you any accomplices?”</p>

<p>“Your honour, I am innocent, as I have already
told you.”</p>

<p>“Answer my question!” said the magistrate sternly.</p>

<p>“No, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Ha! You alone are guilty then. Captain, are
there any witnesses? though it is hardly necessary.
The man’s face shows his guilt.”</p>

<p>It will easily be seen how much hope the prisoner
had of getting off with such a judge presiding at the
trial. Luckily for the cause of justice the man was
undoubtedly guilty, and so the judicial proceedings,
hurried and one-sided as they were, did not entail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
any injustice. In a short time the trial was ended,
and the man convicted and sentenced to execution
on the following morning. Meanwhile he was to be
confined in a structure set apart as a prison.</p>

<p>“Well, are you satisfied?” asked the captain, as he
passed the ringleader of the miners.</p>

<p>“I don’t see the use of waiting till morning,”
grumbled the miner. “The job might as well have
been finished up at once.”</p>

<p>“You can rest satisfied. The man hasn’t long to
live.”</p>

<p>This proved to be the case. During the night
Harry and Jack, who were accommodated with beds
in a hut near the prison, heard a noise and a sound
of men’s voices, but they were too fatigued and worn-out
to be thoroughly roused. In the morning, when
they left the hut, they needed no explanation. From
a lofty branch of a gum-tree a hundred yards to the
west dangled the body of the unfortunate criminal,
a terrible spectacle, contrasting painfully with the
bright and cheerful morning. They learned afterward
that the prison had been guarded by a volunteer
company of miners, who detected the prisoner
in an attempt to escape, and forcing an entrance,
laid violent hands upon him, and saved the law
officers the trouble of executing him.</p>

<p>The captain of police didn’t learn what had happened
till morning. As it chanced, Obed Stackpole
was with him when he received the information.</p>

<p>He took it very coolly.</p>

<p>“What are you goin’ to do about it, captain?”
asked Obed.</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Do you allow such doin’s here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“It doesn’t matter much. The man was to have
been executed this morning at any rate. He only
lost a few hours. It has saved us some trouble.”</p>

<p>“Suppose he was an innocent man?”</p>

<p>“But he wasn’t, you know. And now, Mr. Stackpole,
if you will come with me, I will see about your
getting your share of the reward.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, captain. I won’t deny that it’ll be
particularly convenient, seein’ I’m reduced to my
last penny.”</p>

<p>The police captain exerted himself in a very
friendly manner, and owing to the absence of red
tape which in an older settlement might have
occasioned delay, that same day our Yankee friend
was made happy by receiving the sum of fifty pounds.</p>

<p>He called the boys to him, and dividing the money,
as well as he could, into three equal parts, he offered
one each to Harry and Jack.</p>

<p>“Now we start alike,” he said. “There’s nearly
seventeen pounds apiece. It seems a good deal, but
it won’t last long. We must find something to do
before long.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I want,” said Harry; “I came out
here to work, and make money, not to loaf about.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way with me,” said Jack, but his tone
was not so hopeful or cheerful as Harry’s.</p>

<p>“Confess now, Jack,” said Harry, “you would
rather be on board ship than here at the diggings.”</p>

<p>“I would,” said Jack; “wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. There is no money to be made on board
ship.”</p>

<p>“When you’ve made your pile, my lad,” said Obed,
“you can go back to Melbourne, and easily get a
berth on board some merchant ship bound to Liverpool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
or New York. There is a great demand for
sailors at that port.”</p>

<p>This made Jack more cheerful. He was willing to
stay a while, he said, and help Harry and Mr. Stackpole,
but in the end he must return to his old life.</p>

<p>Mr. Stackpole and the boys took a long walk, and
reconnoitred the diggings on both sides of Bendigo
creek. Towards the middle of the afternoon they
came upon a thin, melancholy looking young man,
who was sitting in a despondent attitude with his
arms folded.</p>

<p>“Are you sick, my friend?” asked Obed.</p>

<p>“I am very ill,” was the answer. “I don’t think
I shall ever be any better.”</p>

<p>Further questioning elicited the information that
he had taken a severe cold from exposure two months
before, in consequence of which his lungs were seriously
affected.</p>

<p>“Why do you stay here, then?” asked Obed.</p>

<p>“I shall go back to Melbourne as soon as I have
sold my claim.”</p>

<p>“What do you want for it?”</p>

<p>“It is worth fifty pounds. I will take twenty-five.”</p>

<p>Obed after careful inquiry judged that it was a
bargain. He proposed to the two boys to join him
in the purchase of the claim. They felt that they
could safely follow his judgment, and struck a
bargain. So before twenty-four hours had passed,
the three friends were joint proprietors of a claim,
and had about eight pounds apiece to meet expenses
till it began to yield a return.</p>

<small>STRIKING LUCK</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap2" src="images/i_106.jpg" width="91" height="75" alt="“N">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">“N</span>OW, boys,” said Obed, “we have some
hard work before us. Mining isn’t like
standing behind a counter, or measuring
off calico. It takes considerable more
muscle.”</p>

<p>“I am used to hard work,” said Jack, “but you’ll
have to show me how.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep up with Jack,” said Harry manfully.</p>

<p>“You won’t have to charge either of us with laziness.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, boys. There isn’t a lazy bone
in either of you. As I have experience, I’ll boss the
job, and you’ll have to obey orders.”</p>

<p>“All right, captain!” said Jack, touching his cap,
with a smile.</p>

<p>This, then, was the understanding between the
three, and it was faithfully adhered to. The two
boys, sensible of their ignorance, were very ready to
obey Obed, and he found them willing workers.
They installed themselves in a cabin which had
been occupied by the man they bought out. He
gave them the use of it, having no further occasion for
it himself, and they began to keep house as one family.
They lived roughly enough, and yet, so high were all
articles of food, on account of the trouble and expense
of transportation from Melbourne, that it cost
them as much as would have paid for living at a
respectable hotel at home.</p>

<p>All three entered upon their labours with high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
hopes. The first day and the second day yielded no
results, but, as Obed reminded them, a miner needs
to be patient. But when one week—two weeks—passed,
and the amount of gold found amounted to
less than two pounds, all three began to look sober.</p>

<p>“This is beginning to look serious, boys,” said
Obed thoughtfully, as they set about their work on
the first day of the third week. “Our claim ain’t
pannin’ out very rich.”</p>

<p>“My store of money is panning out very fast,” said
Harry, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“I’ve got less than two pounds left,” said Jack.
“What are we going to do when it’s all gone?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Obed, “unless we catch
another murderer.”</p>

<p>The boys smiled, but not hilariously. They felt,
as Obed expressed it, that matters were indeed
becoming serious. To run short of money nearly
ten thousand miles from home was no light thing.</p>

<p>“We might sell the claim,” suggested Harry.</p>

<p>Obed shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we could,” he replied. “Everybody
would understand our reason for selling—that we
despaired of finding any gold—and instead of getting
twenty-five pounds, I doubt if you could get twenty-five
shillings for it. You know about how long
twenty-five shillings would last us.”</p>

<p>“I suppose there is nothing to do but to keep on,”
said Harry.</p>

<p>Obed nodded. “You’ve said it,” he returned.
“Let us keep up good heart, my boys. Don’t
borrow trouble. When things come to the worst
we’ll decide what to do then.”</p>

<p>By way of setting the example of cheerfulness Obed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
began to whistle “Yankee Doodle,” and the boys joined
in. It was not altogether a successful effort, but it
made them feel a little more cheerful. At all events
it attracted a listener—a tall, shabby-looking tramp,
who had been wandering about for a day or two,
visiting one claim after another, trying to raise a loan.</p>

<p>“I say, you’re uncommon jolly, you chaps,” he
began, as he stood in a lounging attitude watching
the little party at their work.</p>

<p>“If we are it’s a credit to us,” returned Obed dryly,
“for there isn’t much to be jolly about.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t your claim a good one?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’re trying to find out. Where’s
yours, stranger?”</p>

<p>The tramp returned an evasive answer and
shambled off.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’s got a claim, Obed?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“No; but he’s prowling around to see what he can
pick up.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’s a thief?”</p>

<p>“I think he’s willing to be. He heard us whistling,
and thought we’d found something.”</p>

<p>“We are safe from robbery—for the present,” said
Harry.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s that advantage about being poor.
It reminds me of old Jack Pierce in our village.”</p>

<p>“What about him?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“He read in the paper one day that a certain bank
had burst. So he went home in a hurry to see if he
had any bills on that bank. He found that he had
no bills on that bank—or any other—and then he
felt better.”</p>

<p>Harry laughed.</p>

<p>“It was a poor consolation, I think,” he said. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
remember hearing a sermon from our minister at
home in which he said that riches were a great
responsibility, but I don’t think I should mind
taking the responsibility.”</p>

<p>“That’s my idea, Harry. I am afraid there isn’t
much chance of our having that responsibility, but
there’s one thing we can do if we don’t make the
claim pay.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Obed?”</p>

<p>“We can join the bushrangers.”</p>

<p>“Will you set us the example?” asked Harry, smiling.</p>

<p>“I’m not quite desperate enough yet. We’ll try
the claim a little longer. But I’m gettin’ tuckered
out. We’ll go and get some dinner, and then start
diggin’ again.”</p>

<p>They repaired to their cabin, and solaced themselves
with food. Then they threw themselves down
in the shadow of the cabin to rest, and Obed pulled
out his pipe. This was a solace which the boys didn’t
enjoy. They were sensible enough to know that,
whatever may be said of men, boys only receive injury
from the use of tobacco. In the resolution to abstain
they were upheld and encouraged by Obed, who,
veteran smoker as he was, did not approve of smoking.</p>

<p>“You’re better off without it, boys,” he said. “It
won’t do you no good. I wish I could leave it off.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Easier said than done, my boy. Let me see, I
was only turned of thirteen when I used to slink off
to the barn and smoke, for I knew father wouldn’t
let me if he knew it. It made me sick at first, but I
thought it was makin’ a man of me, and I kept on.
Well, the habit’s on me now, and it’s hard to break.
It don’t hurt a man as much as a boy, but it don’t
do him any good either. Jack, did you ever smoke?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“No, Obed; but one of the sailors gave me a piece
of tobacco to chew once. I didn’t like it and spat it
out.”</p>

<p>“The best thing you could do. I wish all boys
were as sensible.”</p>

<p>In their hours of rest the three often chatted of
home. Their conversation was generally of one
tenor. They liked to fancy themselves returning
with plenty of money, and planned how they would
act under such pleasant circumstances. Instead of
the barren hills among which they were encamped,
familiar scenes and faces rose before them, and the
picture was so attractive that it was hard to come
back to the cheerless reality.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said Obed, at the end of an hour,
“we may as well go to work again. The gold’s
waitin’ for us.”</p>

<p>It was an old joke, and scarcely elicited a smile
now. In fact, the boys felt that they had waited a
long time for the gold. It was not, therefore, with a
very hopeful feeling that they obeyed the summons
and returned to the claim. Though of a sanguine
disposition, they began to doubt seriously whether
their efforts would ever be rewarded. They had
pretty much lost the stimulus of hope.</p>

<p>About four o’clock, when Jack was at work with
the pick, something curious happened. Instead of
sinking into the earth, it glanced off as from something
hard.</p>

<p>“What is it, Jack?” asked Obed quickly.</p>

<p>“I must have struck a rock, Obed.”</p>

<p>“Here, give me the pick,” said Obed eagerly.</p>

<p>He struck, and lo! a yellow streak became plainly
visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“Boys,” said he, in an agitated voice, “I believe our
luck has come.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Obed?”</p>

<p>“I believe we’ve found a nugget;” and to the
boys’ intense surprise he immediately began to cover
it up with dirt.</p>

<p>“What’s that for?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Hush! we mustn’t take it out now. Somebody
might be looking. We’ll wait till it’s darker.”</p>

<p>Just then a tramp strolled up.</p>

<p>“What luck, friends?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Same as usual,” answered Obed, shrugging his
shoulders. “Don’t you want to buy the claim?”</p>

<p>“Not I,”—and the tramp, quite deceived by his
manner, kept on his round.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky we covered up the gold,” said Obed, in
a low voice. “That’s the last man I wanted to
discover our good luck.”</p>

<p>“Shan’t we keep on working?” asked Harry, in
excitement.</p>

<p>“I will just probe a little to form some idea of the
size of the nugget,” answered Obed.</p>

<p>“Then you think it is a nugget?” asked Jack
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think our luck has come at last, boys. I
think we will be able to pull stakes and go back
home. But about keeping on now, we shall need to
be cautious. Some one might come by, and see what
we are about.”</p>

<p>Then Harry made a suggestion.</p>

<p>“Let Jack go up to the top, and if any one comes
he can whistle. That will put us on our guard.”</p>

<p>“A good idea!” said Obed.</p>

<p>So Jack threw himself on the ground in a listless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
posture, and the other two continued their explorations.
They dug all about the boulder, which proved
to be about a foot in diameter. It was embedded in
clay, from which it was separated with some difficulty.
It was encased in quartz, but the interior
was bright, glittering gold.</p>

<p>“It’s a regular beauty,” said Obed, in a low tone,
his eyes glittering with excitement.</p>

<p>“How much do you think it’s worth, Obed?”
asked Harry, in the same low tone.</p>

<p>“That’s hard tellin’, Harry; but it’s worth a thousand
pounds easy.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” ejaculated Harry fervently. “That
will release us from our imprisonment, and enable
us to go back home.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Harry, but the hardest job lies
before us.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“To get it out without observation, and keep it
secure from thieves.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our best. Only you give the orders, Obed.”</p>

<p>“Then, first and foremost, we’ll cover it up again,
and go up till evening, when we will secure it and
carry it to our cabin.”</p>

<p>So said, so done. They joined Jack at the limit of
the excavation.</p>

<p>“Is it all right?” asked the young sailor eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>Jack was told of their plan of removing the nugget
by night, and saw at once that it was a wise one.</p>

<p>“Shall we go to the cabin now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, Jack; it won’t do to leave our treasure unguarded.
We will lounge here, and make sure that
no one robs us of our discovery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>So they sat down, and Obed lighted his pipe once
more.</p>

<p>A neighbour strolled up and sat down beside them.</p>

<p>“You are leaving off work early,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Obed, with a yawn, “we might as
well take it easy. It’s hard work—this mining.”</p>

<p>“What luck?”</p>

<p>“Our luck is to come,” said our Yankee friend.
“How is it with you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got out seventy-five dollars this week,”
answered the other complacently.</p>

<p>“Whew! that’s good! What do you say to
swapping claims?”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” answered the neighbour, wagging his
head jocosely. “I’m not so green. The fact is, Mr.
Stackpole, I don’t want to discourage you, but I
don’t believe you’ll ever see the money you put into
this hole. Come now, what did you pay?”</p>

<p>“Five and twenty pounds.”</p>

<p>“If you can get five pounds for it, my advice is sell.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but you’re right,” said Stackpole in a
rueful tone. “Will you give me five pounds for it?”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho! I might give you five shillings, though
it would be a risk.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t think we’ll sell, eh, Harry?”</p>

<p>“We had better give it away than take that sum,”
said Harry, carefully veiling his inward exultation.</p>

<p>They went to their cabin at the usual time and
indulged themselves in a better supper than usual,
feeling that they could afford to do so. It is wonderful
how success stimulates the appetite.</p>

<p>“I don’t know when I have been so hungry,
Obed,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“I feel the same way,” chimed in Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“A light heart increases the appetite, boys, but
sometimes I’ve felt wolfish when my heart was
heavy. Fifteen months ago I was in Californy and
down on my luck. Things had been goin’ contrary,
and I hadn’t money enough to buy a square meal.
I didn’t like to tell my friends, bein’ a bit proud.
One day when I was feelin’ so hungry that I wouldn’t
have turned up my nose at a Chinaman’s diet—rat pie—an
old acquaintance met me and asked me to dine
with him. Did I accept? Well, I should smile. I
did smile all over my face, as I sat down to the table.
You’d better calculate that I made my knife and
fork fly. Finally my friend remarked, looking kind
of queer, ‘You’ve got a healthy appetite, Stackpole.’
I answered, ‘It sort of runs in our family to eat
whenever we get a chance.’ ‘Good joke!’ said he,
laughing. But it was no joke when he came to pay
the bill, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remember that, Obed,” said Harry, smiling,
“and when I invite you to dinner, I’ll first inquire
whether you’ve had anything to eat for a week back.”</p>

<p>“I generally eat for a weak stomach,” returned
Obed, venturing on a little joke at which the boys
felt bound to laugh.</p>

<p>As they sat at the door of their cabin, they kept a
good lookout in the direction of their claim. They
could not afford, now that success was in their grasp,
to have it snatched away. But they discovered no
suspicious movements on the part of any one. In
fact, no one suspected that they had “struck it rich.”
So poor was the general opinion of their claim, that
they would have found it hard to obtain a purchaser
at any price. Had there been the least suspicion, the
camp would have been greatly excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>As a rule, the miners retired early. They became
fatigued during the day, and sleep was welcome.
There was, indeed, a gambling saloon at some
distance, frequented by the more reckless, but
generally good hours were observed in the camp.</p>

<p>About half-past eleven, Obed nudged Harry and
Jack, who had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Harry, in a drowsy tone.</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered Obed. “Don’t make any
more noise than you can help. I think it will be
safe to go and secure the nugget now.”</p>

<p>This was enough. Harry was wide awake in an
instant, and he in turn roused Jack.</p>

<p>There was no elaborate toilet to make, for they had
thrown themselves down in their day attire. They
left the cabin, and by the faint light of the moon,
which was just ready to retire for the night, they
found their way to the claim without being observed.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes’ work and the task was accomplished.
The nugget was raised, and wrapped
in a red bandanna handkerchief, which Obed had
brought all the way from his New England home.</p>

<p>“It must weigh seventy-five pounds,” whispered
Obed exultantly. “Boys, we’re in tall luck. It was
worth coming out to Australy for. We’ll keep it in
the cabin over night, and to-morrow we’ll put it
where it will be safe.”</p>

<p>They gained the cabin without having been seen
so far as they knew. Of the hundreds of men sleeping
within a furlong’s distance, not one dreamed of a
discovery which was to draw the attention of the
whole colony to Bendigo. But they had not wholly
escaped observation. One pair of eyes had detected
them in their midnight walk.</p>

<small>THE NUGGET IN DANGER</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_116.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="T">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE tramp, who has already been introduced
to the reader, had spent the evening
at the gambling house, having come
into possession during the day of a small
sum of money, given him by a compassionate
miner. He had risked it, and for a time been
successful, so that at the end of an hour he might
have left off with twenty pounds. But the fatal
fascination of the game drew him on till all his
winnings melted away, and he left the cabin at midnight
without a penny in his pocket, so far as he
knew. There was, however, a shilling which he had
overlooked, and did not discover till he was already
some distance away. He was tempted to return, and
probably would have done so, had not his roving eyes
discovered Obed and the two boys returning from
their claim with the nugget.</p>

<p>“What are they up to,” he asked himself in amazement,
“that keeps them out of bed till after midnight?
There’s something up. I wonder what it is.”</p>

<p>He had reason to be surprised. With the exception
of those who, like himself, spent the night in gambling
(when he was in funds), no one in the camp was
awake or stirring. And of all, none kept more
regular hours than Obed and the two boys.</p>

<p>Casting about for some explanation, the tramp’s
attention was drawn to the burden that Obed carried.</p>

<p>“What can it be?” he asked himself wonderingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Then, with a flash of conviction, he said to himself:
“A nugget. They’ve found a nugget as sure as I’m a
sinner.”</p>

<p>The tramp was intensely excited. His covetous soul
was stirred to its depths. The opportunity he had
been waiting for so long had come at length. It meant
fortune for him. Qualms of conscience about appropriating
the property of another troubled him not at all.
He meant to have the nugget, by fair means or foul.</p>

<p>The would-be thief understood well, however, that
there would be difficulties in the way of accomplishing
his design. Obed and the two boys were broad
awake, and half-an-hour—perhaps an hour, must
elapse before he could feel sure that they would be
asleep. In the meantime it would be best to keep
away from the cabin, lest some one inside might see
him lurking near, and suspect his purpose.</p>

<p>While he is keeping watch from a distance, let us
enter the cabin.</p>

<p>Obed and the boys are sitting on their rude pallets,
congratulating themselves on having secured the
nugget, and removed it from the mine unobserved.
Harry had made a remark to that effect, when Obed
Stackpole responded, “Do you know, boys, I feel
sort of uneasy to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid some one might have seen us on our
way from the mine.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t see anybody,” Harry remarked.</p>

<p>“Nor I, but there may have been some one, nevertheless.
The fact is, I never expected to be uneasy
on account of my wealth, but that’s the way the case
stands just at present. When we were poor I slept
like a top.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“I suppose you wouldn’t care to get rid of your
care by throwing the nugget away,” Harry said, with
a smile.</p>

<p>“I’m not so uneasy as that yet, but I should feel a
little safer if we and the nugget could be transported
to Melbourne in five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Suppose some one did see us?” queried Jack.</p>

<p>“Then we may expect a visit some time to-night.”</p>

<p>“One of us might remain awake, Obed.”</p>

<p>“That would be rather hard on us, for we are all tired.
I don’t believe I could stay awake all night if I tried.”</p>

<p>“Is there any way of concealing the nugget?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. If we had a cellar that would be a
good place, but——”</p>

<p>“Stop, I have an idea!” cried Harry eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, Harry, out with it.”</p>

<p>“We can put the nugget in the trunk.”</p>

<p>There was an old trunk, covered with hair, which
had been left by the last occupant of the cabin. The
lock was broken, and it was not of much use or value,
but the boys occasionally used it as a seat.</p>

<p>“What security would that be?” said Obed. “It
is easy enough to open the trunk.”</p>

<p>“I know it, but I have another idea. Wrap up that
stone in the handkerchief in place of the nugget. The
thief—if one should come—would see it, and make off
with it without stopping to examine its contents.”</p>

<p>Obed smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” he said. “I believe you’re
right, boy. It’s dark, and the thief couldn’t tell the
difference till he came to examine it.”</p>

<p>Stones and fragments of rock are rare in that part
of Australia, and I am not prepared to explain how
this particular rock found its way into the mining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
village. The boys had found it, however, and thinking
it might be of some use had carried it to the
cabin. Never, however, in their wildest imaginings
had it entered into their minds to conceive the use to
which they were now putting it.</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. The nugget was taken
from the enfolding bandanna and dropped into the
trunk, which Obed placed at the head of his pallet.</p>

<p>“I wish there was a lock and key,” he said. “I
should somehow feel safer.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use wishing,” said Harry. “We’ve got to
take things as we find them.”</p>

<p>“That’s true philosophy, boy. Now get the rock
and tie it up.”</p>

<p>Harry did so.</p>

<p>“Where shall I put it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Anywhere where it can be seen easily. We won’t
trouble the thief to look round much. We’ll make
everything easy for him.”</p>

<p>When the transfer was effected, the boys laughed
with glee.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Obed,” said Harry, “I shall be
rather disappointed now if the thief doesn’t come.”</p>

<p>“I can get along without him,” said Obed dryly.</p>

<p>“But it’ll be such a good joke, Obed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care so much about jokes as I did when I
was your age, Harry. I used to be a great feller for
jokes when I was along in my teens. Did I ever tell
you the joke I played on the schoolmaster?</p>

<p>“Well, I was attendin’ the district school the winter
I was sixteen, and I expect I was rather troublesome,
though there wasn’t anything downright bad about
me. But I remember one day when I stuck a bent
pin in the chair the master usually sat in, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
shan’t forget till my dyin’ day how quick he riz up
when he sat down in it.”</p>

<p>Obed chuckled at the recollection, and so did the
boys. Their sympathies ought to have been with the
schoolmaster, but I am sorry to say that did not
prevent their enjoying the joke.</p>

<p>“Were you found out?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but I think the master always suspected
me. At any rate he was always cuffin’ me
and pullin’ my hair. I didn’t mind the fust so much
as the last. So one day I got my mother to cut my
hair close to my head. When I went to school the
master gave me a queer look. He knew what made
me have my hair cut. The next time I got into
mischief he called me up, and instead of pullin’ my
hair he pulled my ears till I hollered. ‘Now go
home and get your ears cut off,’ he said, but I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me the joke was on you that time,
Obed.”</p>

<p>“I’ve surmised as much myself,” said Obed, laughing
quietly. “But I’m tired, boys, and I believe I
shall have to go off to sleep, nugget or no nugget.”</p>

<p>“All right! Good-night, Obed.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, boys.”</p>

<p>The thief had little difficulty in entering the cabin.
No one in the mining settlement thought of locking
the outer door or closing the windows. In many
cases the door was left ajar; in some cases there were
none. It was not necessary, therefore, to become a
housebreaker. Entrance then was the least difficulty.</p>

<p>The tramp, however, was not quite easy in his
mind. He didn’t care for the two boys, but he
glanced with apprehension at the reclining figure of
the tall gaunt Yankee, who was thin but wiry, and
possessed of more than ordinary physical strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“If he should tackle me,” thought the midnight
visitor with a shudder, “it would be all up with me.
He could shake the life out of me.”</p>

<p>But the stake was a valuable one—it would in
all probability make him comfortable for life, if
judiciously husbanded—and Obed’s slumber seemed
so profound that there appeared to be no risk.
Nevertheless the tramp trembled, and his heart was
in his mouth as he stealthily got in through the
open window, and moved towards the nugget, or
what he supposed to be such. He had one eye on
Obed as he reached for the bundle. It was with
difficulty that he could lift it, so heavy was it, but
this only encouraged him, and made his eyes sparkle
covetously. The heavier it was, the more valuable
it must be. Were it twice as heavy he would be
willing to carry it ten miles, enduring cheerfully all
the fatigue it might entail. No thought of the
rightful owners or of their disappointment disturbed
him. That greed of gain which hardens the heart and
banishes all scruples held firm dominion over him.</p>

<p>He lifted the bundle, and as noiselessly as he
entered he made his egress through the window.</p>

<p>He thought he was unobserved, but he was
mistaken.</p>

<p>Harry Vane was usually a heavy sleeper, but
the thought of the nugget, even in his sleeping
hours, weighed upon him and entered into his
dreams. Singularly, he was dreaming at this very
moment that it was being stolen, and in the intensity
of his excitement all at once he became broad awake,
just as the thief was disappearing through the window.
With a startled look he glanced toward the
place where the false nugget had been placed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>It was gone!</p>

<p>Evidently the thief had been taken in, and the
thought amused him so much that he almost unconsciously
laughed aloud. The sound fell on the
ears of the receding thief, and filled his heart with
apprehension, though he fancied it was a sound
emitted in sleep. Still, it might precede awakening.</p>

<p>Once out of the window he did not stand upon
the order of his going, but fled with a speed remarkable
considering the weight of the bundle he
carried.</p>

<p>Harry rose from his bed, and though he felt sure
the thief had been deceived, he still, in order to
make sure, opened the trunk and felt for the lump
of gold. With a thrill of joy he found it still there.
Then he could give way to his sense of amusement,
and laughed long and loud. He did not, however,
arouse Jack and Obed, who, like himself, were sound
sleepers. He didn’t like, however, to have all the
amusement to himself, so he shook the Yankee till
he awoke.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Obed, in a drowsy tone.</p>

<p>“We’ve been robbed,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Mr. Stackpole in dismay,
bounding from his pallet, now thoroughly awake.
“What is that you say?”</p>

<p>“The nugget is gone!” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Confusion!” ejaculated Obed. “When? Who
took it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, Obed,” said Harry quietly.
“It’s only the bogus nugget. The real one is safe
where we hid it.”</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it, Harry. What skunk has
been in here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“You know—the man that was spying about our
claim—the tramp.”</p>

<p>“Did you see him?”</p>

<p>“Not till he was just getting out of the window!”</p>

<p>Harry recounted briefly his sudden awakening, and
the sight that greeted him as he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“I wish I’d been awake. I’d have boosted him out
of that window,” said Obed grimly.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt you would, Obed,” said Harry
laughing, “but I think we needn’t feel much of a
grudge against the poor fellow. When he comes to
examine his booty by daylight, it’s my impression
he’ll feel sick enough.”</p>

<p>Obed laughed to. “I’d like to be looking on when
he makes the discovery,” he said. “He’ll look green
enough, I guess.”</p>

<p>“How could the fellow have found out that we had
found it?” said Harry, with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>“He must have been out late and seen us coming
from the mine.”</p>

<p>“It is lucky we thought of hiding it, and leaving
the rock in its place, Obed.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. The rock came in handy for once.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there is any danger of another visit
to-night?”</p>

<p>“No; he probably won’t discover how he has been
tricked till morning.”</p>

<p>“And even if he does he may suppose that this
rock is what we brought with us.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. Still, Harry, I think we’d better keep
awake and watch to-night. It will only be for one
night, as to-morrow we can make arrangements to
send the nugget by express to Melbourne.”</p>

<p>“I thought we should be carrying it there ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“No, it would not be safe. To-morrow everybody
will know that we have found a nugget, and if we
attempted to carry it ourselves we should not get
ten miles away without being attacked, and perhaps
killed.”</p>

<p>“Then we can send it by express?” queried Harry.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have inquired into this—not that I thought
we would be lucky enough to need the information.
The government escorts charge one per cent., and
besides the Crown exacts a royalty of ten per cent.”</p>

<p>“That’s pretty steep, isn’t it, Obed?”</p>

<p>“I will cheerfully bear my part of it,” said Obed.
“I remember there was an old fellow in our
place who owned considerable property—at any rate
he was taxed for fifteen thousand dollars. Whenever
taxes became due he was always groanin’ and predictin’
that he’d end his days in the poorhouse. My
father, who was only taxed for fifteen hundred, said
to him one day, ‘Mr. Higgins, if you’ll give me half
of your property, I’ll agree to pay taxes on the
whole, so that you’ll have nothing to pay.’”</p>

<p>“Did he accept?” asked Harry, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Not much, but he stopped growlin’. It may have
given him a new idea of the matter.”</p>

<p>“How soon do you think of getting away, Obed?”</p>

<p>“As soon as we have sold the claim,” answered the
Yankee. “When it gets reported round the camp
what we’ve found there’ll be plenty that’ll want to
buy it on speculation, you may be sure of that.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of that,” said Harry, his eyes
brightening. “We’re luckier than I thought.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Obed jocularly, “we’re men of
property now. I’m afraid we’ll have to pay taxes
ourselves when we get home.”</p>

<small>A THIEF’S EMBARRASSMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap2" src="images/i_125.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="W">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">W</span>HEN the thief left Obed Stackpole’s cabin
with his booty his heart was filled with
exultation. He had been drifting about
for years, the football of fortune, oftener
down than up, and had more than once
known what it was to pass an entire day without
food. And all this because he had never been willing
to settle down to steady work or honest industry.
He had set out in life with a dislike for each, and a
decided preference for living by his wits. Theft was
no new thing for him. Once he had barely escaped
with his life in one of the Western States of America
for stealing a horse. He had drifted to Australia,
with no idea of working at the mines or anywhere
else, but with the intention of robbing some lucky
miner and making off with the proceeds of his
industry.</p>

<p>Now, he had succeeded, and his heart was light.</p>

<p>“No more hard work for me,” he said to himself
joyfully, “no more privation and suffering. Now I
can live like a gentleman.”</p>

<p>It never seemed to occur to him that a thief could
by no possibility live like a gentleman. To be a
gentleman, in his opinion, meant having a pocketful
of money.</p>

<p>He would like to have examined the nugget, but
there was no time, nor was there light enough to form
an opinion of it. Besides, Obed and the two boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
might at any moment discover their loss, and then
there would be pursuers on his track. He could not
hide it, for it was too large, and any one seeing what
he carried would suspect its nature and character.</p>

<p>The responsibility of property was upon him now.
It was an unaccustomed sensation. This thief began
now to dread an encounter with other thieves. There
were other men, as well as himself, who had little respect
for the rights of property, and this he well knew.</p>

<p>“Where shall I go?” he asked himself in perplexity.</p>

<p>It would not do to stay in the neighbourhood of
the mining camp. By dawn, or as soon as tidings of
the robbery should spread, there would be an organised
pursuit. In any mining settlement a thief
fares hard. In the absence of any established code
of laws, the relentless laws of Judge Lynch are executed
with merciless severity. Beads of perspiration
began to form on the brow of the thief as he realised
the terrible danger he had incurred. What good
would it do him after all to get away with the
nugget if it should cost him his life, and that was a
contingency, as his experience assured him, by no
means improbable.</p>

<p>“If I were only in Melbourne,” he said to himself,
“I would lose no time in disposing of the nugget,
and then would take the first ship for England—or
anywhere else. Any place would be better than
Australia, for that will soon be too hot to hold me.”</p>

<p>It was one thing to wish, and another to realise the
wish. He was still in the immediate vicinity of the
mining camp, and there were almost insuperable
difficulties in the way of getting far from it with his
treasure safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>The thief kept on his way, however, and after a
while reached a piece of woods.</p>

<p>“This will be a good place to hide,” he bethought
himself. “I may be able to conceal the nugget
somewhere.”</p>

<p>His first feeling of exultation had given place to
one of deep anxiety and perplexity. After, he was
not as happy as he anticipated. Only yesterday he
had been poor—almost destitute—but at any rate
free from anxiety and alarm. Now he was rich, or
thought he was, and his heart was filled with nervous
apprehension.</p>

<p>He wandered about for two or three hours, weary
and feeling great need of sleep, but afraid to yield to
the impulse. Suppose he should lose consciousness,
and sleep till morning: the first man who found him
asleep would rob him of the precious nugget, and
then he would be back again where he had been
the day before, and for years back. The dream of his
life had been fulfilled, and he was in no position to
enjoy it. Oftentimes God grants our wishes only to
show us how little they add to our happiness.</p>

<p>At last he saw before him a cabin—deserted, apparently.
It would afford him a place to obtain
needed repose, and there would be some means of
hiding his rich treasure.</p>

<p>He peered timidly into the cabin and found it
empty. On the floor in the corner was a pallet. He
put the nugget under the upper part, thus raising it
and supplying the place of a pillow. It was hard
enough, as the reader will imagine, but it was better
than nothing, and appeared to combine safety with
a chance to rest.</p>

<p>The thief fell asleep, and slept soundly. When he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
awoke it was bright, and the morning was evidently
well advanced. In an instant consciousness came,
and with anxious thought he felt for the nugget.
It was still there, as he realised joyfully. He was
on the point of examining the nugget, when a step
was heard. He looked up startled, and saw a man
entering the cabin. This man was such another as
himself—an adventurer—and the tramp remembered
to have seen him about the camp.</p>

<p>“Halloa!” the new arrival said, gazing with a little
surprise at the prostrate man.</p>

<p>“Halloa!” returned the other, surveying the new
arrival with apprehension.</p>

<p>“Is this your crib?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m only passing the night here.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I seen you at the mines?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have been there.”</p>

<p>“And now you are leaving, are you?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t made up my mind. I don’t know. I
want to get away for one thing.”</p>

<p>“So do I. Suppose we keep company, friend. Two
are more social than one, eh?”</p>

<p>This proposal gave the first man anxious thought.
If he had a companion, he could not hide for any
length of time the fact that he was in possession of
the nugget. Yet he did not know how to refuse
without exciting suspicion. The new arrival noticed
it, and it stirred up anger in him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ain’t good enough for you?” he added,
frowning.</p>

<p>“No, no, it isn’t that,” said the first eagerly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want me to go with you?” demanded
the new arrival bluntly. “Yes or no.”</p>

<p>“Have you got any money?” asked the thief,
“because I haven’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“No more have I. We’ll be equal partners.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m afraid we won’t get very far.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get as far as I will. But I say, what is
that under your head, pard?”</p>

<p>The question had come at last. The thief trembled
and answered nervously:</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s—I am using it for a pillow,” he faltered.</p>

<p>“Let us see your pillow,” said the new arrival
suspiciously.</p>

<p>The thief came to a sudden determination, suggested
by necessity. Two would make a stronger
guard than one, and, though this man was not the
one he would have selected, accident had thrown
them together, and he would risk it.</p>

<p>“Look here, my friend,” he said, “it’s a great
secret.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a secret, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I am going to make you my confidant.
I am greatly in need of a friend and partner, and I’ll
make it worth your while to stand by me. I’ll give
you a quarter of—what I have here—if you’ll see me
safe to Melbourne.”</p>

<p>“What is it, pard? Out with it, quick!”</p>

<p>“It’s—a nugget, and the biggest one that’s been
found at Bendigo since they commenced mining.”</p>

<p>“A nugget! Great Jehoshaphat! Let me see it!”</p>

<p>The thief drew the bundle—still wrapped in Obed’s
red bandanna—from underneath the pallet, while his
companion in intense excitement bent over to catch
a glimpse of the treasure.</p>

<small>BAFFLED CUPIDITY</small></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_130.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="A">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span>N expression of surprise and dismay,
almost ludicrous, appeared on the faces
of the two adventurers as the contents
of the handkerchief were revealed.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s nothing but a rock!” exclaimed
the new-comer, with an oath.</p>

<p>The thief stared at him in helpless consternation,
and was unable to utter a word.</p>

<p>“What does all this mean?” asked the new-comer
sternly. “If you are humbugging me, I’ll——” and
he finished the sentence with an oath.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it means,” answered the thief,
in a disconsolate tone. “I’m just as much surprised
as you are.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get it? How came you to make
such a fool of yourself?” demanded the new-comer,
frowning heavily.</p>

<p>“You know that Yankee and the two boys who
have a claim next to Pickett’s?”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Last night I was coming from the Hut”—that
was the local name of the cabin devoted to gambling
purposes—“when I saw them coming from their
claim. The Yankee had this—rock tied up in yonder
handkerchief. Of course, I supposed it was a
nugget. No one would suppose he was taking all
that pains with a common rock.”</p>

<p>“Go on! Did you follow them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Yes; that is, I kept them in sight. They entered
their cabin, and I waited, perhaps three-quarters of
an hour, till they had time to fall asleep.”</p>

<p>“Were you near the cabin all the time?”</p>

<p>“No; I didn’t care to be too near for fear I should
be observed. I wanted the nugget, but I didn’t want
to run any risk.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt you were very prudent,” said the
second, with an unpleasant sneer. Doubtless he
would have done the same, but his disappointment
was so great that he could not resist the temptation
of indulging in this fling at the man who had unintentionally
contributed to it.</p>

<p>“Of course I was,” said the first, with some indignation.
“Would you have had me enter the cabin
while they were all awake, and carry it off under
their very eyes? That would be mighty sensible.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, then you would have got the genuine
nugget.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Do you think there was a
nugget?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do. It’s as plain as the nose on your
face, and that’s plain enough, in all conscience.
They’ve played a trick on you.”</p>

<p>“What trick?”</p>

<p>“It appears to me that you are mighty stupid, my
friend. They hid away the real nugget, and put this
in its place. That Yankee is a good deal sharper
than you are, and he wasn’t going to run no
risks.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe this?” asked the thief, his jaw
falling.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt of it. They’ve had a fine laugh
at you before this, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Just my luck!” ejaculated the thief dolefully.
“After all the pains I’ve taken, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is hard lines on a poor industrious man
like you!” said the new-comer cynically. “You’re
not smart enough to be a successful thief.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are,” retorted the other resentfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, I flatter myself I am,” returned the other
composedly. “When I take anything, at any rate
I have the sense to take something worth carrying
away—not a worthless rock like this. You must
have had a fine time lugging it from the mines.”</p>

<p>“It nearly broke my back,” said the thief gloomily.</p>

<p>“And now you don’t know what to do with it?
Take my advice, my friend, and carry it back to the
original owner. He may find it handy another
time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be blessed if I do,” growled the unhappy thief.</p>

<p>“I doubt that,” said his companion dryly. “However,
do as you please. It don’t interest me. I don’t
think on the whole I will accept your offer of a
partnership. When I take a partner I want a man
with some small supply of brains.”</p>

<p>The first looked at him resentfully. He did not
like these taunts, and would have assaulted him had
he dared, but the new-comer was powerfully built,
and evidently an unsafe man to take liberties with.
He threw himself back on the pallet and groaned.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the second after a pause, “when
you’ve got through crying over spilt milk, will you
kindly tell me where I can get something to eat?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Humph! that’s short and to the point. It is
something I would like very much to know, for my
part. I feel decidedly hungry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“I have no appetite,” said the luckless thief
mournfully.</p>

<p>“You will have, after a while. Then you can’t
think of any cabin near by where we could get a
breakfast?”</p>

<p>“There’s Joe’s.”</p>

<p>“Are you acquainted with Joe?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is your credit good with him?”</p>

<p>“I think he would trust me for a breakfast.”</p>

<p>“And me? You can introduce me as a friend of
yours.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t been talking like a friend of mine,”
said the first resentfully.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. However, you must make allowances
for my natural disappointment. You led me
into it, you know.”</p>

<p>“If it comes to that, I have done you no harm.
Even if the nugget wasn’t real, you had no claim
to it.”</p>

<p>“You excited my hopes, and that’s enough to rile
any man—that is, when disappointment follows.
However, there’s no use crying over spilt milk. I
have an idea that may lead to something.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the thief, with some eagerness.</p>

<p>“I will tell you—after breakfast. My ideas don’t
flow freely when I am hungry. Come, my friend,
get up, and lead the way to Joe’s. I have an aching
void within, which needs filling up. Your appetite
may come too—after a walk.”</p>

<p>Somehow this man, cool and cynical as he was,
impressed his fellow adventurer, and he rose
obediently, and led the way.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew what was your idea,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Well, I don’t mind telling you. I believe the
Yankee did find a nugget.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t got it, but you may get it—that is,
we may get it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how. He will be on his guard now.”</p>

<p>“Of course he will. I don’t mean that we should
repeat the blunder of last night. You may be sure
he won’t keep it in his cabin another night.”</p>

<p>“Then how are we to get it?”</p>

<p>“Follow him to Melbourne. He’ll carry it there,
and on the way we can relieve him of it.”</p>

<p>“There’s something in that.”</p>

<p>“We shall be together, and he won’t take me in as
readily as he did you. After breakfast, if we are lucky
enough to get any, we must go back to the camp,
and find out what we can about his plans. Do you
think any one saw you last night when you were in
the cabin?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That is well. Then you won’t be suspected. But
I can’t say a word more till I have had breakfast.”</p>

<p>After half-an-hour’s walking—it was only half a
mile, but the soil was boggy, rendering locomotion
difficult—they reached a humble wayside cabin,
which was in some sort a restaurant, and by dint of
diplomacy and a promise of speedy payment, they
secured a meal to which, despite their disappointment,
they did ample justice.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, they resumed their fatiguing walk,
and reached the mining camp about ten o’clock.</p>

<p>Fatigued by their exertions of the previous days
and the late hours they had kept, Obed and the
boys rose at a later hour than usual. About eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
o’clock Obed opened his eyes, and noticed that his
two young companions were fast asleep.</p>

<p>“It’s time to get up, boys,” he said, giving them a
gentle shake.</p>

<p>The boys opened their eyes, and realised, by the
bright sunshine entering the cabin, that the day was
already well advanced.</p>

<p>“What time is it, Obed?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Past eight o’clock. We shall be late at our work.”</p>

<p>He smiled, and his smile was reflected on the
faces of the boys. Their success of the day before
made it a matter of indifference whether they accomplished
a good day’s work or not.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do about the nugget,
Obed?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“After breakfast we will carry it to the office of
the commissioner, and get his receipt for it.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to get it out of our hands,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“If that is the case, Jack, suppose you give your
share to me,” said Harry, in joke.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to get rid of it in that way,” said
the young sailor.</p>

<p>“You would be as ready to give it as I to accept
it,” said Harry. “No, Jack, I want you to have
your share. I am sure you will have a use for it.”</p>

<p>After breakfast the three emerged from the cabin,
bearing the precious nugget with them. They did
not meet any one on their way to the office of the
commissioner, for all the miners had gone to their
work. This suited them, for until they had disposed
of the nugget, they did not care to have their
good luck made public.</p>

<p>The royal commissioner was a stout Englishman
with a red face and abundant whiskers of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
colour. He chanced to be at the door of the office as
the party appeared.</p>

<p>“Well, can I do anything for you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; you can give us a receipt for this nugget.”</p>

<p>“Nugget!” ejaculated the commissioner, fixing
his eyes on the burden which Mr. Stackpole carried.
“You don’t mean to say that you have found a
nugget of that size!”</p>

<p>“That’s just what we’ve done,” answered Obed.</p>

<p>“When did you find it?”</p>

<p>“Well, we took it from the mine about midnight.
We found it in the afternoon, but calculated we’d
better take possession when there wasn’t so many
lookin’ on. I say, Mr. Commissioner, I don’t think
it would agree with me to be a rich man. I got
broken of my rest last night, from havin’ the nugget
in the cabin.”</p>

<p>“You ran very little risk. No one could have
found out that you had it in your possession,”
remarked the commissioner.</p>

<p>“That’s where you are mistaken, commissioner.
We came near being robbed of it only an hour after
we brought it home.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! How did that happen?”</p>

<p>“A pesky thief sneaked in, and carried it off, as
he thought.”</p>

<p>“How could he think he carried it off when he did
not?”</p>

<p>Upon this Obed explained the trick to which he
had resorted, and the commissioner laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Do you know the man—the thief, I mean?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a man that has been prowlin’ round the
camp for some weeks, not doin’ anything, but watchin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
for a chance to appropriate the property of some
lucky miner. I’d like to see the fellow’s face when
he opens the handkerchief this morning, and finds
the rock.”</p>

<p>“It appears you have lost a handkerchief, at any
rate,” said the commissioner, with a smile.</p>

<p>“He’s welcome to it,” answered Obed, “if it will
comfort him any. I brought it away from home two
years ago, and now I can afford to buy another.”</p>

<p>By this time the nugget had been carried into the
office and exposed to view.</p>

<p>“It is a splendid specimen,” said the commissioner
admiringly. “It is certainly the largest that has
been found in this camp.”</p>

<p>“Have any been found before?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Yes; six months ago a Scotch miner named
Lindsay found one weighing twenty-two pounds and
some ounces.”</p>

<p>“Is he here now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and without a shilling.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t his nugget benefit him any then?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>“It became a curse to him. He obtained some
hundreds of pounds for it, and all went in three
months.”</p>

<p>“How did he get rid of it?”</p>

<p>“In drinking and gambling. Two months since he
drifted back to the camp in rags. He did not have
money enough to buy a claim, but being a good
practical miner he got a chance to work a claim on
shares for another man, who had just come out from
Melbourne, and who knew very little of mining. I
hope you will make better use of your money. Are
these boys your partners?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Yes, Mr. Commissioner, they are equal partners.
What’s one’s luck, is the luck of all.”</p>

<p>The commissioner then weighed the nugget, the
three awaiting the result with great interest.</p>

<p>“It weighs seventy-four pounds and four ounces,”
he announced. “My friend, it will be famous in the
annals of Australia. If I am not mistaken, when it
is known it will create a stampede to our mines.”</p>

<p>“About how much do you think it will realise?”
asked Obed.</p>

<p>“At a rough guess, I should say three thousand
pounds. It may be more and it may be less.”</p>

<p>Obed Stackpole’s rough face was fairly radiant.</p>

<p>“I say, boys,” he remarked, turning to Harry and
Jack, “that’s a pretty good day’s work, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I should say so, Obed.”</p>

<p>The commissioner made out a receipt, which Obed
put away carefully in his pocket.</p>

<p>“That’s better than carrying the nugget round,” he
said.</p>

<p>“I suppose you will go to Melbourne,” said the
commissioner.</p>

<p>“Yes, we shall start in a day or two.”</p>

<p>Here Obed paused, for it occurred to him that
there were practical difficulties in the way of carrying
out his plan.</p>

<p>“That is,” he added slowly, “if we can raise the
money. I suppose we can’t borrow on the nugget?”</p>

<p>“No, but I can suggest a way out of your difficulties.
You can sell your claim. It will realise a good
round sum, as the one from which the nugget has
been taken.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Mr. Commissioner. Thank you for the
suggestion. Boys, there is still some business before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
us. We’ll realise something extra, it seems. I don’t
care how much, if it’s only enough to take us to
Melbourne.”</p>

<p>Just then a miner entered the office, and, seeing the
nugget, instantly made it his purpose to report the
lucky find throughout the camp. The effect was
instant and electrical. Every miner stopped work,
and there was a rush to the commissioner’s office to
see the nugget. All were cheered up. If there was
one nugget, there must be more. Confidence was
restored to many who had been desponding. Obed
and the two boys were the heroes of the hour, and
the crowd came near lifting them on their shoulders,
and bearing them off in triumph.</p>

<p>Obed felt that this was a good time to sell the claim.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, “we struck it rich and no mistake.
How rich I don’t know. There may be other nuggets
where this came from. But I and my partners want
to go back home. The claim’s for sale. Who
wants it?”</p>

<small>SELLING THE CLAIM</small></h2>
</div>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">“L</span>ET’S adjourn to the mine,” said Tom
Lewis, a short, sturdy Englishman.</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s see the place where the
nugget was found,” echoed another.</p>

<p>“All right! I’m agreeable,” said Obed.</p>

<p>Followed by a crowd of miners, Obed Stackpole
strode to the claim where he had “struck it rich.”
In spite of his homely face and ungainly form there
was more than one who would have been willing to
stand in his shoes, homeliness and all. The day
before little notice was taken of him. Now he was a
man who had won fame at a bound.</p>

<p>They soon stood around the lucky claim.</p>

<p>“It isn’t much to look at, gentlemen,” said Obed,
“but looks is deceptive, as my old grandmother used
to tell me. ‘Handsome is as handsome does,’ and
this ’ere hole’s done the handsome thing for me and
my partners, and I venture to say it hasn’t got
through doin’ handsome things. It’s made three of
us rich, and it’s ready to make somebody else rich.
Who’ll be the lucky man? Do I hear a bid?”</p>

<p>“Fifty pounds,” said Tom Lewis.</p>

<p>“That’ll do to start on, but it won’t do to take.
Fifty pounds I am offered. Who says a hundred?”</p>

<p>A German miner offered a hundred, and Tom Lewis
raised ten pounds.</p>

<p>A Scotch miner, Aleck Graham, offered a hundred
and twenty-five.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>From that time the bids rose slowly. Obed showed
himself an excellent auctioneer—indeed he had had
some experience at home—and by his dry and droll
remarks stimulated the bidding when it became dull,
and did not declare the claim sold till it was clear no
higher bid could be obtained.</p>

<p>“Three hundred pounds, and sold to Frank Scott,”
he concluded. “Mr. Scott, I congratulate you. I
calculate you’ve made a pretty good investment, and
I shouldn’t wonder if you’d find another nugget
within a week. ‘Birds of a feather flock together,’ as my
writing-book says, and ‘it never rains but it pours.’”</p>

<p>Frank Scott came forward and made arrangements
for the payment of the sum he had offered. Within
five minutes he was offered an advance of twenty-five
pounds for his bargain, which put him in good
humour, though he declined it. I may as well say
here, since we are soon to say farewell to Bendigo,
that the claim yielded him double the amount of his
investment, and though this was not up to his expectations,
he had no reason to regret his purchase.</p>

<p>The little crowd of miners were just separating
when two new-comers appeared on the scene. They
were the well-matched pair who had met earlier in
the morning at the deserted cabin. For convenience’
sake we will call them Colson and Ropes, the former
being the man who had stolen the nugget, as he
supposed.</p>

<p>“What’s all this crowd?” said Colson, in a tone of
curiosity.</p>

<p>Ropes put the question to Tom Lewis, who chanced
to be passing.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you heard about the nugget?” asked
Lewis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“What nugget?” asked Colson innocently.</p>

<p>“That slab-sided Yankee, Obed Stackpole, found a
nugget last night—a regular monster—and he’s been
selling his claim. I bid for it, but I didn’t bid high
enough.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the nugget?” asked Colson eagerly.</p>

<p>“In charge of the commissioner, who will send it
under escort to Melbourne.”</p>

<p>Colson expected this intelligence. Still he looked
downcast. The chance of getting hold of it under
such circumstances seemed very small.</p>

<p>“What did the claim go for?” questioned Ropes.</p>

<p>“Three hundred pounds. Frank Scott bought
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty steep price.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but there may be another nugget.”</p>

<p>“And there may not.”</p>

<p>“Then he’ll be a loser. Of course there’s a risk.”</p>

<p>“Is the Yankee going to stay around here?” asked
Colson.</p>

<p>“No; he and the two boys are going to Melbourne.
I believe they are going back home.”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame that such a prize should go to
Americans,” said Colson, in a discontented tone.</p>

<p>He would have been very glad to head a movement
for robbing Obed and the boys of the proceeds
of their lucky discovery on this flimsy ground. But
Tom Lewis was a fair-minded man.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what that has to do with it,” said he.
“They found it, and they have a right to it. Of
course, I’d rather it had been me; but it wasn’t, and
there’s an end of it.”</p>

<p>“Some people are born lucky!” grumbled Colson,
as Lewis walked away. “I never had any luck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“The nugget you found wasn’t quite so valuable,”
returned Ropes grimly.</p>

<p>“No; I tugged away for nothing. My arms and
shoulders are stiff enough this morning. And now
the nugget is out of our reach.”</p>

<p>“But not the three hundred pounds,” said Ropes
significantly.</p>

<p>“The price of the claim?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, but it won’t do us any good.”</p>

<p>“The Yankee will carry that with him. It’s worth
trying for.”</p>

<p>The suggestion seemed to strike Colson favourably.
The two held a whispered consultation, which seemed
to yield mutual satisfaction. They were, indeed,
congenial spirits, and agreed upon one point, that it
was better to make a living by knavery than by
doing honest work for honest wages. Yet there is
no harder or more unsatisfactory way of living than
this. Ill-gotten gains seldom benefit the possessor,
and the plans of wicked men often fail altogether.</p>

<p>Gradually the two had drawn near to the claim,
and at last drew the attention of Obed and the boys.</p>

<p>Obed’s thin face lighted up with satisfaction as he
recognised the man who had attempted to steal the
nugget.</p>

<p>“Good-mornin’, squire,” he said politely. “You
look kind of tired, as if you was up late last night.”</p>

<p>Colson eyed him sharply. “Does he suspect?”
thought he. “Yes,” he answered, in an indifferent
tone, “I didn’t rest very well.”</p>

<p>“Where did you pass the night?”</p>

<p>“’Round here,” he answered vaguely.</p>

<p>“You look as if you had been taking a long walk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“You are very observing,” said Colson, not over
pleased.</p>

<p>“I always was. It pays a man—sometimes.”</p>

<p>“I hear you’ve struck it rich,” said Colson, not
caring to take notice of the other’s significant tone.</p>

<p>“Found a nugget, they tell me,” interpolated Ropes.
“How big was it?”</p>

<p>“Weighs about seventy-five pounds!”</p>

<p>“That is luck!” said Colson, with a sickly smile.
He could scarcely help groaning as he thought of
his loss.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, it is tolerable fortunate. I reckon me
and the boys will be able to take it easy for a few
years. But we came near losin’ it, after all.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” Colson asked, but he did not
venture to meet Obed’s glance.</p>

<p>“Some skunk saw us bringin’ back the nugget,
and prowled round till he thought we was all asleep.
Then he got into the cabin and carried it off. That
is, he thought he did, but we was a little too sharp
for him. We tied up a big rock in my handkerchief,
and I guess he had a sweet time carryin’ it off.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! A good joke!” said Colson, but his
laughter was mirthless.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d enjoy the joke, squire,” said
Obed. “How I pity the poor fellow! His arms
must ache with luggin’ the old rock. The best of it
is we know the fellow that took it.”</p>

<p>“You do?” ejaculated Colson, his jaw dropping.</p>

<p>“Yes; Harry woke up just in the nick of time and
saw him scootin’ out of the cabin. If I should tell
the boys ’round here, I reckon they’d lynch him!”
added Obed quietly.</p>

<p>“Just so,” assented Colson, but his face was of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
sickly hue, and taking Ropes by the arm he hurried
him away.</p>

<p>“That fellow’s well scared,” said Obed, turning to
his two young companions. “I reckon he’ll make
himself scarce till we’re out of the way.”</p>

<p>Obed and the boys made arrangements to travel
with the party sent by the commissioner as an escort
to the nugget and other sums entrusted to it by
different miners. The strong guard gave them a
sense of security which they would not have had
under other circumstances.</p>

<p>They were all in high spirits. They were no longer
penniless adventurers, but, though not rich, were
possessed of enough gold to make them feel so.
Now that they were well fixed they were all filled with
a strong desire to see their home across the sea.</p>

<p>“I suppose, Obed, you’ll be getting married soon
after you reach home?” said Harry.</p>

<p>“The very first thing I shall do will be to pay off
the mortgage on dad’s farm,” said Mr. Stackpole. “I
want to see him a free man, with a home that can’t be
taken from him. Then I’ll look after the other matter.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Obed. I only wish I had a father
to help and care for,” said Harry soberly.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a stepfather,” said Jack, “but I don’t
feel much like helping him.”</p>

<p>“You have a mother, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I shall have to be careful about giving
her money, for her husband would get it away from
her before long.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys, we won’t borrow trouble before the
time comes. For all I know Suke Stanwood may
have got tired of waitin’ for me, and married some
other feller.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“In that case, Obed, I suppose you would die of a
broken heart.”</p>

<p>“Not much, but I don’t mind sayin’ that I should
feel uncommon blue.”</p>

<p>Two days elapsed before Obed and his party started
on their return trip. Meanwhile Colson and Ropes
had disappeared. The boys had expected to see
them about the camp, but they had vanished.</p>

<p>“I wonder what has become of them?” said Harry,
just as they were starting.</p>

<p>“I reckon they’re hatchin’ some new mischief, wherever
they are,” returned Obed composedly. “You may
be sure they’re not engaged in any honest work.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Colson is trying to sell his nugget,”
suggested Jack with a smile.</p>

<p>“He’s welcome to all he can get for it,” said Obed.</p>

<p>Obed was very near the truth in his conjecture.
Their greed was excited by thoughts of the nugget
which our three friends had discovered, and their
brains were busied with plans for obtaining possession
of it. The chances didn’t seem very encouraging.
It was under strong escort, and it would be sheer
madness for the two to attack an armed party. It
would require a much larger force than they could
command to make an attack at all practicable.</p>

<p>With no special plans, but with the hope that
something would turn up in their favour, the two
men started for Melbourne in advance of the government
party. They were indebted for the requisite
funds to a successful theft by Colson, who was an
expert in his line. It is unnecessary to chronicle
their daily progress. We will look in upon them on
the fourth day.</p>

<p>They were making toilsome progress over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
boggy road, when all at once they were confronted
by three bushrangers headed by Fletcher.</p>

<p>“Surrender, or you are dead men!” exclaimed
Fletcher, with a boldness which will be easily understood
when it is considered that his force outnumbered
the travellers two to one.</p>

<p>Neither Colson nor Ropes appeared to be frightened.
Indeed, they were looking for such an encounter.</p>

<p>“All right, gentlemen,” said Ropes quietly. “We
are quite ready to surrender.”</p>

<p>“Empty your pockets,” was the next order.</p>

<p>“All right again!” said Ropes. “I am sorry to
say we haven’t much to surrender.”</p>

<p>“Is this all you have?” asked Fletcher, frowning
when a pound and ten shillings were delivered to him
as their united contributions to the bushrangers’ fund.</p>

<p>“We haven’t a penny more.”</p>

<p>“Search them!” said Fletcher to his followers.</p>

<p>A search, however, failed to bring to light anything
more.</p>

<p>“Why, you poor tramps!” exclaimed Fletcher in
disgust. “You are unworthy the attention of gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, captain,” replied Colson. “May I
have a word with you in private?”</p>

<p>Not without suspicion Fletcher granted this unexpected
request, and stepped aside with Colson a
few paces, taking care, however, to keep near enough
to his party to insure his safety.</p>

<p>“Well, what have you to say?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“I have no money to give you,” replied Colson,
“but I have information that will enable you to
obtain a great deal.”</p>

<p>“What is your object in telling me this?” demanded
Fletcher, still suspiciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“The fact is, my friend and I want to join with you
in the enterprise, and get a fair share of the booty.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish to join our band, then?”</p>

<p>“Well, not permanently, but for a little while.”</p>

<p>“Out with the information, then!”</p>

<p>“Will you agree to our terms?”</p>

<p>“What are they?”</p>

<p>“We want half of the prize.”</p>

<p>“You are very modest,” said Fletcher, in a sarcastic
tone. “How much will it amount to?”</p>

<p>“Not far from twenty thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>Fletcher pricked up his ears. This was indeed a
prize worth trying for.</p>

<p>“Give particulars,” he said.</p>

<p>“A big nugget is on the way to Melbourne, or will
be in a day or two. It was found at Bendigo. I
don’t know how much it will net, but probably
seventy-five thousand dollars. Then there is a
considerable amount of dust besides.”</p>

<p>“Who is to carry it? Is it in the hands of a
private party?”</p>

<p>“No, it is under government escort.”</p>

<p>Fletcher’s countenance changed.</p>

<p>“That is a different matter,” he said. “There is
danger in attacking a government party.”</p>

<p>“Think of the big sum at stake.”</p>

<p>“It would require the co-operation of the whole
band.”</p>

<p>“Suppose it does.”</p>

<p>“There will be more to divide it among. The captain
would not agree for a moment to give away half.”</p>

<p>“Say a third, then.”</p>

<p>“I am not authorised to make any bargain. That
will be for the captain to decide. You had better
tell me all you know about it, and I will lay it before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
the captain and secure you the best terms I can on
conditions——”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“That you give me quarter of your share.”</p>

<p>“That is unreasonable,” said Colson, disappointed.</p>

<p>“Then go ahead and rob the government train
yourself.”</p>

<p>Colson saw that he was helpless, and must submit
to any terms proposed. He accordingly signified his
assent.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Fletcher, “you may come
with us, and I will introduce you to the captain. By
the way, who found the nugget? You have not told
me that.”</p>

<p>“A Yankee and two boys.”</p>

<p>“What was the Yankee’s name?” asked Fletcher
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Stackpole—Obed Stackpole.”</p>

<p>Fletcher whistled.</p>

<p>“I know the man,” he said. “The boys are about
sixteen—one a sailor?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I know them all, and I owe them all a grudge.
There is nothing I should like better than to take all
they have and leave them penniless.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like them myself,” said Colson, thinking this
was the way to curry favour with his new acquaintance.</p>

<p>“You know them also?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they have treated me meanly.”</p>

<p>Colson probably referred to their substituting a
common rock for the rich nugget, and so subjecting
him to mortification and disappointment.</p>

<p>Fletcher asked him a few more questions, and then
with the new accessions plunged into the woods, and
led his party to the headquarters of the bushrangers.</p>

<small>TAKEN CAPTIVE</small></h2>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_150.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="T">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE new recruits, on being introduced to
the captain of the bushrangers, were subjected
to a searching examination by the
chief, a suspicion having arisen in his
mind that the two were spies sent out by
the government to lure the outlaws into a trap. He
was convinced after a while that they were acting in
good faith, and a conference was called to decide what
should be done in the matter. On this point opinions
differed. The nugget, of course, would be a valuable
prize, but it would be impossible to dispose of it in
Melbourne, as the fact of its discovery would have
been published, and any person attempting to sell it
would be instantly arrested. This view was held by
Captain Ring himself.</p>

<p>“That objection is easily met,” said Fletcher.</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“One of the band could be sent to England to
dispose of it. He could carry it in his trunk as ordinary
luggage.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would like to undertake the commission,”
said Captain Ring.</p>

<p>“I should be very willing,” said Fletcher eagerly.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt you would,” returned the captain,
in a sarcastic tone. “Who would insure your making
over the proceeds to us?”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t doubt my integrity,” said
Fletcher, with an air of virtuous indignation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Perhaps I had better say nothing on that subject,
Fletcher. The band are unwilling to subject you to
the temptation—that’s all. Many good men go
wrong.”</p>

<p>“You might send some one with me,” suggested
Fletcher, unwilling to give up the tempting prospect.</p>

<p>“We haven’t got the nugget yet,” answered the
captain dryly.</p>

<p>Colson and Ropes had listened with interest to the
discussion. They began to fear that nothing would
be done. They would have been as much opposed as
any one to trusting Fletcher, as he had not inspired
them with confidence. It takes a rogue to detect a
rogue, and they already suspected his true character.
Colson’s hope of revenge on Obed Stackpole seemed
slipping through his fingers.</p>

<p>“The Yankee and the two boys have a good deal
of gold about them,” suggested Colson. “Of course
it isn’t much compared with the nugget, but it is
better than nothing.”</p>

<p>“How much has the Yankee?” demanded Ring.</p>

<p>“Three hundred pounds at least.”</p>

<p>“That is something, but as he will travel with the
government escort, we should have to attack the
whole party.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. I have a plan that I think will
work.”</p>

<p>“Detail it.”</p>

<p>Colson did so. What it was will appear in due
time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Obed and the two boys had started on
their way to Melbourne. With a strong military
escort they gave themselves up to joyful anticipations
of the bright future that opened before them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
They no longer entertained apprehensions of being
waylaid, being secure in the strength of their party.</p>

<p>They travelled by easy stages, and at night camped
out. A sentry was always posted, who stood guard
while the rest were asleep, for, unlikely as an attack
might be, it was deemed necessary to provide against it.</p>

<p>Often, however, after supper Obed and the two boys
would take a walk together, in order to talk over their
plans without interruption from others. On the third
evening they unwittingly walked a little further than
usual. Harry was the first to notice it.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better return, Obed?” he said. “We
must be a mile from the camp.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Obed. “It would be rather
unlucky to meet with the bushrangers, just as we are
gettin’ on so well.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; we mustn’t run any risks.”</p>

<p>They started to return, when Jack, stopping suddenly,
said, “I thought I heard a groan.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” said Harry.</p>

<p>They paused, and the groan was repeated. It
appeared to come from a little distance to the left
in the recesses of the forest.</p>

<p>“If there’s any poor critter in pain we ought to
help him,” said Obed. “Come along, boys!”</p>

<p>It was not difficult to discover the spot from which
the groan proceeded. A man of middle age lay
outstretched beneath a tree, with an expression of
pain on his face.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, my friend?” asked Obed,
standing over him.</p>

<p>“The bushrangers have robbed and beaten me,”
said the prostrate man feebly.</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! How long since?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“About an hour.”</p>

<p>“Then they must be near by,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“No; they went away as soon as they got my money.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jack had been attentively examining
the face of the alleged victim. He quietly beckoned
to Harry to move off to a little distance.</p>

<p>“Well, Jack, what is it?” asked Harry, somewhat
surprised.</p>

<p>“That man is one of the bushrangers. I remember
his face very well. It is one of the gang that
captured us.”</p>

<p>Harry was naturally startled.</p>

<p>“Are you sure of this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know him as well as I do Obed.”</p>

<p>“Then it is a plot. We must get away if we can.
There is danger in staying here.”</p>

<p>“You are right there, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I will go up and take Obed’s place while you call
him away.”</p>

<p>Harry advanced to the side of the victim, and said
quietly, “Jack wishes to speak to you a moment,
Obed. He thinks we can carry this gentleman with
us, as he has lost all his money.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Obed, and walked to where Jack
was standing.</p>

<p>Harry scrutinised the man’s face, and he too recognised
him as one of the gang—but his face did not
betray his suspicions.</p>

<p>“Were you robbed of much money?” he asked, in
a sympathising tone.</p>

<p>“I had the value of a hundred pounds with me,”
said the other feebly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you came from Bendigo like ourselves?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“Yes; have you been lucky?”</p>

<p>“We had some luck, but we are tired of mining,
and are going back to Melbourne. Would you like
to have us take you along also?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you would be so kind.”</p>

<p>At this moment Obed’s voice was heard.</p>

<p>“Come here, Harry; we’ll make a litter to carry our
friend there if he is unable to walk.”</p>

<p>“All right, Obed.”</p>

<p>There might have been something in Obed’s voice
that betrayed him. At any rate, the victim, looking
up, eyed him keenly, and then, to the surprise of the
boys, gave a sharp whistle. Their suspicions were at
once kindled, and they started to run, but too late.
From the underbrush there sprang out three bushrangers,
accompanied by Colson and Ropes, who
covered the boys with their weapons.</p>

<p>“Halt there!” exclaimed Fletcher, in a tone of
authority.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” said Obed with apparent
coolness, though his heart sank within him.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s I, Mr. Stackpole,” returned Fletcher, with
a grim smile. “I hope you’re better fixed than when
we met last. I hear you’ve found a nugget.”</p>

<p>“One of those gentlemen with you can give you
information about that,” said Obed, indicating Colson.</p>

<p>Colson frowned and bit his lip.</p>

<p>“He has told us about it.”</p>

<p>“Ask him for it then. He broke into our tent the
night we found it and carried it off.”</p>

<p>“Is this true?” demanded Fletcher, eyeing Colson
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“No, it’s a lie. The nugget is in charge of a
mounted escort on the way to Melbourne.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“What have you done with <i>your</i> nugget, Colson?”
asked Obed.</p>

<p>Colson did not reply.</p>

<p>“There’s no time to waste here. Stackpole, you
and the boys will have to go with us. Here, you two
men, close behind them. We must not let them
escape.”</p>

<p>The party started with the captives in the middle.
It was decidedly a bad outlook for our three friends.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the reflections of Obed
and the two boys were far from pleasant. The cup of
happiness had been dashed from their lips just as
they had begun to taste it. Then again it was very
mortifying to watch the exultation of Fletcher and
Colson, who had finally triumphed over them after
being successfully baffled.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is,” said Obed to Harry, who was
walking alongside of him, “that them skunks have
got the best of it. It’s their time to crow now.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I feel,” said Harry soberly. “I
believe I would rather have lost twice as much to
anybody else.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t lost all, that’s a comfort. They will
take the money we have with us, but if ever we escape to
Melbourne, there is the nugget money waiting for us.”</p>

<p>Just then Colson stepped up with a smile on his
face.</p>

<p>“It strikes me I’ve got about even with you, friend
Stackpole,” he said.</p>

<p>“Don’t call me friend, Colson; I don’t own any
man as a friend who acts like you. So you’re a
bushranger, are you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” answered Colson, amazed.</p>

<p>“It looks like it,” remarked Obed significantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“I am merely in the company of the bushrangers
just at present.”</p>

<p>“Aiding and abetting them in their scheming.
That’s so, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t any interest in the plunder, then?”</p>

<p>Now one of the bushrangers was within hearing,
and Colson didn’t venture to say “No,” or it would
be virtually giving up his share of the money taken
from Obed and the boys.</p>

<p>“I don’t care to answer any of your questions,” he
said stiffly.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder—not a mite, Colson. Still I’d
like to ask one.”</p>

<p>“What is it? I don’t promise to answer it,
though.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you find that nugget rather heavy?”
asked Obed slyly.</p>

<p>Colson didn’t answer, but frowned, for the subject
was a sore one.</p>

<p>“How many miles did you carry it, if I may be so
bold?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to discuss the subject.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t if I were you. It makes me laugh
when I think how you must have looked when you
found out it was nothing but common rock.”</p>

<p>“How much does it weigh?” inquired Colson, in a
tone of curiosity.</p>

<p>“Somewhere between fifty and five hundred
pounds. Are you thinking of attacking the guard?
I wouldn’t if I were you. They are prepared for
gentlemen of your kind. You’d be more likely to
carry off lead than gold.”</p>

<p>“Confound the fellow!” thought Colson. “He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
looks as if he had the best of me—I must worry him
a little.”</p>

<p>“Do you know that you are in a very ticklish
position?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I can’t say it’s a position I fancy much. Did you
put our friends here on the track?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” answered Colson, in a tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I thought so. That identifies you with them,
Colson. You may find it used against you in a
court of justice.”</p>

<p>“I am no more a bushranger than you are,” said
Colson uneasily.</p>

<p>“I would respect you more if you was, Colson.
They’re open and aboveboard, anyway. You want
to profit by the same means, but sneak out of it and
say you’re not a bushranger. It’ll be hard to persuade
the courts of that.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to do with courts.”</p>

<p>“You may have yet. Let me give you a piece of
advice.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Colson suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Join the band permanently. You’re a man after
Fletcher’s own heart. You and he will make a good
match.”</p>

<p>“Who is that mentioning my name?” asked
Fletcher, who happened to be within hearing.</p>

<p>“I took that liberty, squire. I’ve been advisin’
Colson here to join your band.”</p>

<p>“What is that for?”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a business that will suit him. His
talents all lie in that direction. He’ll be like a
brother to you, Fletcher.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“He don’t like the idea. He seems to feel above
you. He says he is only keepin’ company with you
for a short time.”</p>

<p>“Is that true?” demanded Fletcher, eyeing Colson
with displeasure.</p>

<p>“I never said any such thing,” said Colson eagerly.
“He twists my words. I have the greatest respect
for the bushrangers, whom I regard as gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that is the reason you don’t feel gratified
to join them, Colson?”</p>

<p>Fletcher laughed at this palpable hit, but Colson
looked annoyed.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to remain in this section of the
country long,” said Colson deprecatingly, for he was
very much afraid of offending Fletcher. “Of course
I can’t form any permanent ties.”</p>

<p>“It might be better for you to leave, Colson.
I’ve an idee that it isn’t good for your health to stay
around here very long. You haven’t made a shinin’
success so far. Now, as to that nugget which you
stole——”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to insult me? I never took any
nugget.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. You’re right there, Colson. But you
thought you had, all the same. Fortunately, it’s
where you can’t get at it.”</p>

<p>“I have something to say on that point,” said
Fletcher. “I understand the nugget is very valuable.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it. You’re a judge. I have an
idee of that sort myself.”</p>

<p>“About how much does it weigh?”</p>

<p>“About seventy-five pounds. I don’t mind gratifying
your innocent curiosity, Fletcher.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Fletcher’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“It must be very valuable,” he said.</p>

<p>“I reckon it is.”</p>

<p>“At what do you estimate it—twenty thousand
dollars?”</p>

<p>“Not as much as that.”</p>

<p>“It ought to come pretty near it, though.”</p>

<p>Obed did not answer.</p>

<p>“It’s a great prize. You were very lucky.”</p>

<p>“So I thought at the time. I don’t feel so certain,
now,” said Obed dryly.</p>

<p>“I think half of it will be enough for you.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Fletcher?”</p>

<p>“I mean that we shall want half of it.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to get it?”</p>

<p>“We mean to hold you prisoner till half the proceeds
are brought in from Melbourne.”</p>

<p>Obed’s countenance fell. He had not thought of
this.</p>

<p>Colson’s eyes glistened with pleasure. Till that
lucky suggestion was made he saw no way of securing
a share of the great prize.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice scheme, Fletcher,” said Obed, regaining
his composure.</p>

<p>“So I think. You and the boys would still have a
good sum of money. What do you say? Shall we
make a little friendly arrangement to that effect?
You could give me an order for half the sum realised,
and on my securing it you would be released.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to talk it over with my partners
here,” returned Obed. “They’re equally interested
with me.”</p>

<p>“Better do so now.”</p>

<p>“I won’t till evenin’, when we have more time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>Fletcher rode away under the impression that Obed
was favourably disposed to his plan.</p>

<p>“When I get the money,” he said to himself, “I
can decide whether to let the fellow go or not. I
don’t care for the boys, but I’d like to give this
Yankee a good flogging, he’s so confoundedly sarcastic.
Plague take it, the fellow doesn’t know when
he’s down, but talks as if he was on equal terms
with me.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though Fletcher did not know it, the
train of bushrangers had steadily advanced to the
neighbourhood of the place where the government
escort were encamped.</p>

<p>In fact, he was ignorant that they were so near.
But Obed knew it, and he was watching his opportunity
to apprise his friends of his situation. Harry
had noticed the same thing. Lest he should make a
premature revelation, Obed placed his hand to his
lips, as a sign of silence. Harry understood, and
seemed indifferent, but his heart was beating fast
with excitement.</p>

<p>It was certainly an oversight in Fletcher not to
have ascertained the situation of the government
encampment. He was under the impression that it
was in a direction opposite to that in which they
were moving, and this determined his course. He
was therefore wholly unconscious of danger, and
tranquil in mind, though his situation was critical.</p>

<p>Obed was puzzled to know in what manner to get
the necessary intelligence to his comrades. Chance
gave him a suggestion. The man next him wore
round his neck a whistle—designed doubtless to use
in case of emergencies. It was of rather peculiar
shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“That’s an odd whistle you’ve got there, my
friend,” he said; “where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“In Melbourne,” answered the fellow unsuspiciously.</p>

<p>“I think I’ve seen one like it in the States. Let
me look at it a minute.”</p>

<p>The bushranger allowed Obed to take it in his
hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Stackpole put it to his mouth, and
gave a sharp, loud whistle that awakened the echoes
in the forest.</p>

<p>Like a flash Fletcher turned from his place at the
head of the train and eyed the bushranger with a
frown. Obed had dropped the whistle, and was
walking on with an innocent look.</p>

<p>“What is this foolery, Hogan?” demanded
Fletcher sharply. “Don’t you know better than to
whistle?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t, lieutenant,” answered Hogan. “It was
this man here.”</p>

<p>“The Yankee?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How did he get the whistle?”</p>

<p>“He asked to look at it.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean, Stackpole?” asked
Fletcher angrily.</p>

<p>“Don’t get riled, squire,” said Obed imperturbably.
“I just wanted to try it, that’s all. I had a whistle
once a little like it. When I was workin’ for old
Deacon Plummer in New Hampshire——”</p>

<p>“I will overlook it this time, but if you take any
such liberty again, I’ll have you tied to a tree and
whipped.”</p>

<p>“That’s better than bein’ shot, anyway. I won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
do it again, squire. I ain’t particularly anxious to
get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“These Yankees are about as stupid and presuming
as any people I ever met,” Fletcher remarked to the
comrade who rode beside him. “That fellow is a
nuisance, but I mean to teach him a lesson before
twenty-four hours are over.”</p>

<p>Obed and the two boys awaited with anxiety the
result of the summons. The camp was but an eighth
of a mile away, but hidden by the trees.</p>

<p>“Will they hear it?” thought Obed.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether this would have been the
case, but luckily for our three friends one of the
escort—by name Warner—was taking a walk in
the woods, and heard the whistle. His curiosity was
excited, and peering through the trees he saw the
bushrangers and their captives.</p>

<p>He was a man of promptness, and returning to the
camp with all expedition made a report to the officer
in command.</p>

<p>“How many are there in the band?” inquired
Captain Forbush.</p>

<p>Warner reported.</p>

<p>The captain immediately started, under Warner’s
guidance, with ten men, and arranged to intercept
the bushrangers.</p>

<p>The first intimation Fletcher had of his danger was
the sudden appearance of the soldiers, who broke
through the underbrush and took the astonished
bushrangers in the flank.</p>

<p>“Surrender instantly, or you are dead men!”
exclaimed Forbush sternly.</p>

<p>Fletcher fell back in dismay, and was at first speechless
with consternation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“Do you surrender?” repeated the government
officer impatiently.</p>

<p>Fletcher’s eye ran over the party that confronted
him. They outnumbered his own forces two to one.
He felt that resistance would be useless.</p>

<p>“We will release our captives if you let us go,”
he said.</p>

<p>“So you would make conditions? You are in no
condition to do that. We propose to free your
captives, and to take you to our camp.”</p>

<p>“You had better not,” said Fletcher, hoping to
intimidate the officer. “Our main band is close at
hand, and they will avenge us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the risk,” said Forbush indifferently.
“Throw down your arms!”</p>

<p>As this order was given with each of the bushrangers
covered by the weapons of his own party, the
bushrangers found it prudent to comply.</p>

<p>“Very well; now follow me.”</p>

<p>First, however, the rifles surrendered by the bushrangers
were gathered up, and in their defenceless
condition they were marched to the government
camp. It added to Fletcher’s annoyance that the
weapons dropped by his party were picked up and
carried by their late captives, Obed and the two boys.</p>

<p>“So you’re comin’ to make us a visit, Fletcher?”
said Obed, with an exasperating smile. “It’s just as
well as if we had gone home with you. We shall be
together anyway, and I know you value our society.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to strangle you,” muttered Fletcher.</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I don’t think I should enjoy it.
I’ve seldom met a kinder-hearted man, Fletcher, but
you have queer ways of showing it.”</p>

<p>Probably the most discomfited members of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
party were Colson and Ropes. All their schemes
had miscarried, and they felt that they were in a
genuine scrape. If they could only convince the
officers that they were innocent companions of the
bushrangers, they might yet escape. Accordingly,
when they reached the camp Colson advanced to
Captain Forbush and said: “Ahem! captain, my
friend Ropes and I wish to express our thanks to
you for your timely rescue, and would like to travel
under your escort to Melbourne.”</p>

<p>“What does the man mean?” asked Forbush,
turning to Obed.</p>

<p>“Suppose you ask him,” suggested Obed, with a
smile of enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Like your friends here we were captured, but a
little earlier. I hope—ha, ha!—you don’t take us
for bushrangers? That would be a great joke, eh,
Ropes?”</p>

<p>“Just so,” answered Ropes.</p>

<p>“Suppose you ask Fletcher,” again suggested Obed.</p>

<p>“Are these men followers of yours, Mr. Fletcher?
They say you captured them.”</p>

<p>“They did, did they?” returned Fletcher, eyeing
the two men in a manner by no means friendly. “It
is a lie. They came to me and reported that your
party were carrying a nugget to Melbourne, and
wanted us to attack you, and get possession of it.
In that case they demanded a share of the proceeds.
The dogs! so they want to get favour at our expense,
do they?”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about them, Mr. Stackpole?”
asked Captain Forbush.</p>

<p>“Yes, captain, and I am convinced that my friend
Fletcher tells the exact truth. That skunk there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
[indicating Colson] tried to steal the nugget the very
night of its discovery, and broke into my cabin for
the purpose. He’s a sly, underhand thief, and not to
be compared with a bold bushranger. I respect them
for their pluck at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe him! He’s prejudiced against us,”
whined Colson.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Captain Forbush, “I will comply
with your request and allow you to travel with me to
Melbourne—under guard!”</p>

<p>Fletcher and the bushrangers looked pleased at
this announcement. Their own prospects were not
very bright, but they were glad to find that Colson
and Ropes were to share their fate.</p>

<small>FAREWELL TO MELBOURNE</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_166.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="N">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">N</span>O further adventures or dangers befell the
party on their way to Melbourne. It was
thought possible that Captain Ring, in
charge of the main body of the bushrangers,
might attempt a rescue of his
companions. No such attack took place. It might
have been that he feared the issue of the conflict,
but it is also possible that he experienced no poignant
regret at the capture of Fletcher, who, he well knew,
would have been glad to succeed him in command.</p>

<p>At first Fletcher was buoyed up by the hope of a
rescue. Then, when that hope faded out, he sought
for an opportunity to escape. In one case he would
have succeeded but for the vigilance of Obed Stackpole.
The latter, awakening suddenly, saw Fletcher,
who in some way had got out of his fetters, stealing
quietly away. He sprang to his feet and intercepted
the fugitive.</p>

<p>“What, Fletcher! you don’t mean to say you are
goin’ to leave us without sayin’ good-bye? We can’t
spare you, really.”</p>

<p>Fletcher tried to shake himself free from the
Yankee’s detaining grasp.</p>

<p>“Let me alone, you scarecrow!” he exclaimed
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Thank you for the compliment, Fletcher,” said
Obed. “I ain’t so han’some as you are, that’s a fact,
but I guess I’m a good deal better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>As he spoke his grip became stronger, and Fletcher
found his efforts to escape absolutely futile.</p>

<p>“I should like to choke you,” he said fiercely.</p>

<p>“I’ve no doubt you would, Fletcher. It would be
a nice amusement for you, but I’m not quite ready for
the operation just yet. When I am I’ll let you know.”</p>

<p>“But for you, I would have got away,” said Fletcher,
in bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>“I guess you would. It’s lucky I opened my eyes
in time. There’d have been mournin’ in this camp if
you’d got away, Fletcher. You’re wastin’ yourself in
the woods. You’re fitted to adorn Melbourne society,
and it won’t be my fault if you don’t arrive there.”</p>

<p>At that moment Captain Forbush awoke.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“One of our friends was takin’ French leave, that’s
all,” said Obed. “I woke just in time to persuade
him to stay a little longer.”</p>

<p>“Ha! so Fletcher was trying to escape, was he?
I am indebted to you, Mr. Stackpole, for frustrating
his plan. We can’t spare him at all events. I would
rather lose any two of his companions.”</p>

<p>“You see, Fletcher, how much we value your
society,” said Obed. “It was cruel in you to leave us.”</p>

<p>“You’re a fool!” exclaimed Fletcher, darting a
look of hate at Obed.</p>

<p>“You never did appreciate me, Fletcher. All I
want is your good.”</p>

<p>Fletcher was secured in such a way that escape
was no longer possible. In due time he and his
comrades reached Melbourne as captives, and were
transferred to the civil authorities. It may be well
to add here that they were tried, and sentenced to a
prolonged term of imprisonment. Colson and Ropes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
fared a little better, their term being only half as
long. They submitted sullenly to their fate, but
singularly seemed more embittered against Obed
Stackpole than against any of the officers through
whose hands they passed. Obed would have fared
badly had he fallen unprotected into their hands.</p>

<p>It was a joyful day for our young hero, as well as
his two companions, when they saw rising before
them the roofs and spires of Melbourne. During the
weeks that had elapsed since their departure, they
had not only “roughed it,” but they had met with a
series of adventures which were pleasanter to remember
than to pass through. Twice they had been
captives, but each time they had been providentially
rescued. Harry felt that God had watched over
him, and delivered him from danger and the schemes
of wicked men, and his confidence and trust in an
Overruling Power were stronger than ever.</p>

<p>It was some days before they secured the money
resulting from the disposal of the nugget. When
the matter was finally arranged, they found themselves
in possession of about four thousand pounds.
This included the sum realised from the sale of the
mining claim.</p>

<p>“That gives us about one thousand pounds apiece,”
said Harry, after a brief calculation.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it,” said Jack, who really seemed
bewildered by his good fortune. “Why, it’s wonderful!”</p>

<p>“So it is, Jack. I dare say you are the richest
young sailor of your age in the world.”</p>

<p>“When does the next steamer start, Obed?”</p>

<p>“In four days. Can you be ready in that time?”</p>

<p>“I would get ready to start to-morrow if necessary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“So would I. Melbourne is a nice city, but I’d
rather be on dad’s farm eatin’ supper in the old
kitchen than in the best hotel here.”</p>

<p>“After all, there’s no place like home, Obed.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact, but perhaps Jack doesn’t feel so.”</p>

<p>“My home isn’t what it was once,” said Jack
soberly. “If mother hadn’t married again it would
have been different, but I never can like or respect
my stepfather.”</p>

<p>“There’s one place you ought to visit before you
start for home, Harry,” suggested Obed.</p>

<p>“I mean to see the city pretty thoroughly before I go,
as I don’t imagine I shall ever come this way again.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, but it isn’t what I mean.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“Do you remember the old gentleman you saved
from a ruffian the night before you started for the
mines?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Woolson, yes.”</p>

<p>“You ought to call, you and Jack.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go this morning. Will you come too, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you anywhere, Harry,” said the young
sailor, whose affection and admiration for Harry were
very strong.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock the boys entered the office of Mr.
Woolson. It was situated in one of the handsomest
blocks in Little Collins Street, and they learned that
he was a wholesale merchant and importer.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Woolson in?” Harry asked of a clerk.</p>

<p>“He is in the inner office. Have you business with
him?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Admitted into the inner office, the boys saw the
old gentleman seated at a large desk with a pile of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
papers and letters before him. They were by no
means certain that he would recognise them, but he
did so instantly.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, my young friends,” he said,
rising and shaking hands with them. “I have
thought of you often, and of the great service you
did me. Have you just returned from the mines?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I hope you have had good luck.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful luck. Jack and I are worth over a
thousand pounds apiece.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! Why, it only seems a week since
you went away.”</p>

<p>“It is nearly three months, and seems longer to us,
for we have passed through a great deal.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to hear a full account, but I have
not time in business hours. Will you dine with me
at my house to-night and spend the evening?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall expect you at six o’clock sharp.”</p>

<p>The boys met the engagement, and passed the
time most agreeably. Jack felt a little bashful, for
Mr. Woolson lived in fine style, and Jack was not
used to an elegant house or table.</p>

<p>When the cloth was removed, Mr. Woolson asked
the boys their plans.</p>

<p>“We intend to sail for home next Saturday,” said
Harry. “That is as far as we have got.”</p>

<p>“If you were willing to stay in Melbourne, I would
give you a place in my counting-house.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir, but I prefer to return home.”</p>

<p>“Then I will give you a letter to my nephew
and business correspondent. He will further any
business views you may have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“And I will do the same for your friend, if he
desires.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Jack, “but I mean to keep
on as a sailor; I hope some day to be a captain.”</p>

<p>“Then I will give you a place on one of our ships,
and you shall be promoted as rapidly as you are
qualified to rise.”</p>

<p>Jack looked gratified, for he knew the value of so
powerful a friend.</p>

<p>Late in the evening the boys took leave of the
hospitable merchant, and three days afterward they
embarked.</p>

<p>We will now return to America, and for the benefit
of those readers who are not familiar with Harry’s
early adventures, as narrated in the story of “Facing
the World,” I will give a brief account of his story
before setting out on the voyage to Australia.</p>

<p>Left an orphan, with a scanty patrimony amounting
to three hundred dollars, Harry left it all in the
hands of his father’s friend, Mr. Benjamin Howard of
Ferguson, and set out, not in quest of a fortune, but
of a livelihood. He had been recommended by his
father to seek a cousin of his, John Fox of Colebrook,
and place himself under his guardianship.
He visited Mr. Fox, but found him so mean and
grasping that he left him after a brief stay, preparing
to face the world without assistance. Mr. Fox, who
had two children, Joel and Sally, was greatly disappointed,
as he had hoped to get control of the boy’s
slender property, and convert it to his own use. He
pursued Harry, but was unable to overtake and
capture him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Months passed, and John Fox heard nothing of his
wandering relative.</p>

<p>One day, however, he came home triumphant.</p>

<p>“Well, Maria,” he said, addressing his wife, “I’ve
heard of Harry Vane.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” ejaculated Joel, his face screwed
up into an expression of curiosity. “What did you
hear? Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Joel,” answered his father, with an attempt at
solemnity, “the judgments of the Lord have fallen
upon your unhappy cousin.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mr. Fox?” asked his wife,
showing curiosity in turn.</p>

<p>“I mean that he is lying dead at the bottom of
the sea.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so tantalising, Mr. Fox. If you know
anything about the boy, out with it!”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Fox spoke in this tone her husband
knew that she would not stand any nonsense. So
he answered without delay. “Soon after he left our
happy home, Maria, he shipped on board the <i>Nantucket</i>,
as a common sailor, I presume, and the ship
was lost off in the Southern Ocean with all on
board.”</p>

<p>“How awful, pa,” said Sally, who alone of all the
family had felt kindly toward Harry, “and he was so
good-looking, too!”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t a bit better-looking than Joel,” said her
mother sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, ma!”</p>

<p>“It’s true. I never could see any good looks in
him, and it doesn’t become you, miss, to go against
your own brother. How did you find it out, Mr.
Fox?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“I came across an old copy of the <i>New York
Herald</i>, giving an account of the disaster, and mentioning
Harry Vane as one of the passengers. Of
course it’s a mistake, for he must have been one of
the common sailors.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon there’s no call for us to put on
mourning,” said Mrs. Fox.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. It might look better.”</p>

<p>“What do we care about Harry Vane?”</p>

<p>“My dear, he left property,” said Mr. Fox significantly.
“There’s three hundred dollars in the
hands of that man in Ferguson, besides the money he
got for saving the train, as much as two hundred
dollars. As we are his only relatives, that money
ought to come to us by rights.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, husband. On the whole, I’ll put a
black ribbon on my bonnet.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll wear a black necktie,” said Joel. “How
much of the money am I to have?”</p>

<p>“Wait till we get it,” said his father shortly.</p>

<p>“What steps do you propose to take in this matter,
Mr. Fox?” queried his wife.</p>

<p>“I’m going to Ferguson to-morrow to see Mr.
Benjamin Howard. Of course he won’t want to give
up the money, but I’ll show him I mean business,
and am not to be trifled with.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, pa,” said Joel approvingly.</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars will give us quite a lift,”
said Mrs. Fox thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“So it will, so it will, my dear. Of course, I’m
sorry to hear of the poor boy’s death, but I shall
insist upon my rights, all the same.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox warmly approved of her husband’s determination,
being quite as mean and money-loving
as he.</p>

<small>A HEART-BROKEN RELATIVE</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_173.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="L">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">L</span>ATE in the afternoon, John Fox knocked
at the door of Benjamin Howard, in the
town of Ferguson. It was a hundred
miles distant from Colebrook, his own
residence, and he grudged the three
dollars he had spent for railroad fare; still he
thought that the stake was worth playing for.</p>

<p>“I am John Fox of Colebrook,” he said, when
Mr. Howard entered the room. “You may have
heard of me.”</p>

<p>“I have,” answered Mr. Howard, slightly smiling.</p>

<p>“I am the only living relative of Harry Vane, that
is, I and my family.”</p>

<p>“I have heard Harry speak of you,” said Mr.
Howard, non-committally.</p>

<p>“Yes, poor boy! I wish he were alive;” and Mr.
Fox drew out a red bandanna handkerchief and
covered his eyes, in which there were no tears.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Mr. Howard,
startled.</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t heard?”</p>

<p>“Heard—what?”</p>

<p>“That he sailed in the ship <i>Nantucket</i>, which was
lost, with all on board, in the Southern Ocean?”</p>

<p>It so happened that Mr. Howard had received a
letter from Harry after his arrival in Australia, and
so knew that Harry was not lost. For a moment he
thought Mr. Fox might have later information, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
saw that it was not so. He decided to draw Mr. Fox
on, and ascertain his object in calling.</p>

<p>“I hope that this is not so,” he said gravely.</p>

<p>“There is not a doubt of it,” answered Fox.
“There’s an account of the loss of the vessel in the
<i>New York Herald</i>. I cut it out, and have it in my
pocket-book. Would you like to see it?”</p>

<p>“If you please.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fox produced the scrap, and asked triumphantly,
“Doesn’t that settle it?”</p>

<p>“Suppose that it does, what then?”</p>

<p>“What then? It follows that Harry’s money
comes to me and my family, as the only surviving
relatives. You’ve got money of his, the boy told me.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“About how much?”</p>

<p>“About three hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“So I thought. That money ought to be handed
over to me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that, Mr. Fox.”</p>

<p>“You don’t see that?” interrogated Fox sharply.
“Do you mean to keep it yourself?”</p>

<p>“Not for my own use; I am not that kind of a
man, Mr. Fox. But I have no authority to hand
the money over in the unceremonious way you
expect.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Isn’t the boy dead?”</p>

<p>“I have no proof of it.”</p>

<p>“What better proof do you want than the <i>New
York Herald</i>?”</p>

<p>“The account in the <i>Herald</i> may contain errors.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you think the boy could swim to shore a
few hundred miles,” suggested John Fox with sarcasm.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think that likely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Then what possible chance had he to escape?”</p>

<p>“He might have been rescued by a passing vessel.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Howard,” said Fox indignantly,
“you don’t mean what you say. You evidently mean
to keep that money from the lawful claimants. I
am not much surprised. I expected it. But I can
tell you here and now that John Fox isn’t a man
to be cheated and imposed upon. I mean to have
my rights.”</p>

<p>“Are you aware, Mr. Fox, that your language is
offensive and insulting?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I came here for justice. That
money ought not to be in your hands, who are no
kith nor kin to Harry Vane. It ought to go to me,
and I mean to sue you for it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Fox, I propose to obey the law, but it appears
to me that you are taking it for granted that Harry
Vane is dead without sufficient proof.”</p>

<p>“What more proof do you want than this paragraph?
The fact is, you don’t want to believe it.”</p>

<p>“No!” answered Mr. Howard in a tone of emotion,
“I don’t want to believe that poor Harry is dead.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said John Fox. “If the boy hadn’t been
foolish and left my happy home, he’d have been
alive to-day. But we can’t alter facts. He’s dead,
and all our grief won’t bring him back.”</p>

<p>Benjamin Howard looked at the man curiously.
“His grief doesn’t seem to be very profound,” he
thought. “I will test him.”</p>

<p>“Even if I were convinced that poor Harry was
dead,” he said, “I should not deliver up the money
till you had established a legal claim to it.”</p>

<p>“So you mean to put all possible obstacles in my
way,” said John Fox, provoked. “I thought so. But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
Mr. Howard, let me tell you that you can’t rob the
orphan.”</p>

<p>“Meaning yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, I mean the dead boy—that is the orphan’s
estate—without settling with <i>me</i>. I am a man of
influence, I’d have you know, and I’ll put the matter
in the hands of the lawyer right off.”</p>

<p>“It might be well, first, to listen to what I have
to say.”</p>

<p>“Aha! he’s scared!” thought John Fox.</p>

<p>“I’m ready to hear what you’ve got to say,” he
answered, “but it won’t influence me a particle.”</p>

<p>“I think it will. Harry Vane is alive!”</p>

<p>“What!” ejaculated John Fox, his face expressing
his dismay. “It’s a lie. I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Georgie,” said Mr. Howard to his little son, who
just then entered the room, “go to my desk and
bring me Harry Vane’s letter.”</p>

<p>This was done at once, John Fox meanwhile sitting
in painful suspense.</p>

<p>“This letter,” said Mr. Howard, taking it in his
hand, “was posted, as you see, at Melbourne,
Australia. Harry was shipwrecked on an island,
from which he finally escaped, and was carried
to Melbourne. He writes me that he has gone
to the mines, and is hoping to find some gold
there.”</p>

<p>“Is this true?” asked Fox, in a hollow voice.</p>

<p>“I will read you the letter, and show you the
signature.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a forgery.”</p>

<p>“No chance of that. I know Harry Vane’s handwriting
well. But you don’t look well, Mr. Fox. I
thought you would be pleased to hear that Harry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
had escaped from the perils of shipwreck and is
alive.”</p>

<p>John Fox did not reply, but after examining the
letter he rose with a rueful countenance, and departed
unceremoniously, a badly disappointed man.</p>

<p>“It’ll cost me three dollars to get back,” he
groaned, “and I shall have to stop at a hotel, for
there is no train till to-morrow. ’Most ten dollars
gone altogether—just thrown away! I’m a very
unlucky man.”</p>

<p>The news he carried home brought grief to Mrs.
Fox and Joel. Only Sally seemed glad that Harry
was still living. For so expressing herself she was
severely rebuked by her mother.</p>

<small>HOME AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_179.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="I">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T was a bright, beautiful morning when
our three friends landed in New York.
Their voyage had been a favourable
one, and they had made some pleasant
acquaintances, but they were overjoyed
to tread once more the familiar streets and
see the familiar sights of the American metropolis.</p>

<p>They registered at a quiet hotel on the European
system, intending to remain in the city a few days.
They sought out a prominent broker and asked his
advice about the investment of their money. He
received them in a friendly manner, and gave them
the best advice in his power. Each reserved three
hundred dollars for present use.</p>

<p>It was a novelty to all of them to be free from
anxiety on the score of money, and it may well be
believed that all enjoyed the feeling.</p>

<p>The second morning, as they were walking down
Broadway, their eyes fell upon a familiar figure.
Directly in front of them they beheld a slender
young man, dressed in the extreme of fashion,
swinging a light cane. As he walked along it
was easy to see that he was on the most comfortable
and agreeable terms with himself, and firmly persuaded
that he was an object of general admiration.</p>

<p>“Montgomery Clinton!” exclaimed Harry and
Jack simultaneously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“You don’t mean to say you know that critter!”
said Obed, eyeing Mr. Clinton with evident curiosity.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was one of the <i>Nantucket</i> passengers, and
shipwrecked with us,” said Harry. “He did not
remain in Australia, but took a return vessel at once.”</p>

<p>“That was lucky. A critter like that wouldn’t be
of much account at the mines.”</p>

<p>“Stop! I am going to speak to him.”</p>

<p>Harry quickened his step, and touched Mr. Clinton
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Clinton turned languidly, but when he saw who it
was his face expressed undisguised pleasure.</p>

<p>“Mr. Vane!” he exclaimed. “I’m awfully glad to
see you, don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t forgotten my friend Jack, I hope,”
said Harry, indicating the young sailor.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see him, too,” said Mr. Clinton, with
modified pleasure, offering two fingers for Jack to
shake, for he had not forgotten that Jack had been a
sailor.</p>

<p>“When did you come from Australia?” asked
Clinton.</p>

<p>“We only arrived day before yesterday.”</p>

<p>“And what luck did you have at the mines?”</p>

<p>“We struck it rich. We are all capitalists, Jack
and all.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! I wish I had gone with you,
really now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’d have liked it, Mr. Clinton.
We had a hard time. We had to wade through
mud and mire, and sleep on the ground, and twice
we were captured by bushrangers. They wanted
Jack and myself to join the band.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so—really?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“They might have made you a bushranger, Mr.
Clinton, if they had caught you.”</p>

<p>“I never would consent, never!” said Mr. Clinton,
with emphasis.</p>

<p>Jack smiled at the idea of the elegant Mr. Clinton
being transformed into an outlaw and bushranger.</p>

<p>“I am awfully glad I did not go with you,” he said,
shuddering.</p>

<p>“Let me make you acquainted with my friend, Mr.
Obed Stackpole, Mr. Clinton,” said Harry. “He was
with us in all our trials and dangers.”</p>

<p>Montgomery Clinton surveyed Obed with evident
curiosity. The long gaunt figure of the Yankee was
clad in a loose rough suit which was too large for
him, and Clinton shuddered at the barbarous way in
which he was attired.</p>

<p>“Glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Stickpole,”
he said politely.</p>

<p>“<i>Stack</i>pole, if it’s all the same to you, friend
Clinton,” corrected Obed. “Glad to see any friend
of Harry’s and Jack’s. You look as if you had just
come out of a bandbox.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” said the gratified dude. “You’re
awfully kind. My friends think I have a little taste
in dress.”</p>

<p>“My friends never paid me that compliment,” said
Obed. “Say, how do you like my fit out?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t think they have very good tailors in
Australia,” said Clinton hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Have you as many pairs of trousers as ever, Mr.
Clinton?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“I have only nineteen, Mr. Vane, but I shall order
some more soon.”</p>

<p>“Nineteen pairs of breeches!” ejaculated Obed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
amazement. “What in the name of Jehoshaphat do
you want of so many?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want to have people get used to
seeing me in the same trousers, don’t you know, so
every day I wear a different pair.”</p>

<p>“It must cost a mint of money to buy so many
clothes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have accounts with four or five tailors.
They’re willing to wait, don’t you know. They
appreciate a gentleman’s custom.”</p>

<p>“How long do they wait?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“I’m owing some two years. There’s lots of fellows
make them wait as long.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t my way,” said Obed. “I pay cash.
Don’t they make a fuss?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they send in their bills, but I don’t take any
notice of them,” said Clinton languidly.</p>

<p>“Then, young man,” said Obed, “let me advise
you to pay your bills, and get back your self-respect.
I’d go six months with only a pair of breeches,
sooner than cheat a tailor out of a new pair.”</p>

<p>“I never wear breeches,” drawled Clinton, with a
shudder. “I don’t know what they are. Mr. Vane,
those trousers you have on are very unbecoming.
Let me introduce you to my tailor. He’ll fit you out
in fashionable style.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I believe I do need a new pair.”</p>

<p>“Will he fit me, too?” asked Obed.</p>

<p>“He don’t make—breeches!” said Clinton disdainfully.</p>

<p>“A good hit, by Jehoshaphat!” exclaimed Obed,
slapping Clinton on the back with such emphasis
that he was nearly upset.</p>

<p>“Don’t hit quite so hard,” said the dude ruefully.
“You nearly upset me, don’t you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“I know it now. The fact is, friend Clinton, you
ought to be shut up in a glass case, and put on exhibition
in a dime museum.”</p>

<p>“How awfully horrid!” protested Clinton.</p>

<p>“You’re more fit for ornament than use.”</p>

<p>“You’re awfully sarcastic, Mr. Stickpole, don’t you
know?” said Clinton, edging off cautiously. “I
must bid you good morning, Mr. Vane, as I have to
buy a new necktie. I will go to the tailor’s any
day.”</p>

<p>“What was such a critter made for, anyway?”
queried Obed, when Clinton was out of hearing.
“He looks for all the world like a tailor’s dummy.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>EFORE leaving New York, Harry Vane
decided to call upon the nephew to
whom Mr. Woolson of Melbourne had
given him a letter of introduction. Upon
inquiry, he found that John Woolson
&amp; Co. (the style of the firm) were large importers in
the lower part of the city.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Jack, he called one morning
Mr. John Woolson, a courteous gentleman, about
forty years of age, received him with politeness,
which changed to cordiality when he had read his
uncle’s letter.</p>

<p>“My uncle writes here that you two young gentlemen
recently rendered him an important service.”</p>

<p>“We were fortunate enough to save him from
being robbed,” said Harry modestly.</p>

<p>“And maltreated, also, I presume,” said the nephew.
“When did you arrive in New York?”</p>

<p>“Last Thursday, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you leave my uncle well?”</p>

<p>“He looked in excellent health.”</p>

<p>“How long do you remain in the city? What are
your plans?”</p>

<p>“We think of leaving to-morrow. We wish to see
friends from whom we have long been parted.”</p>

<p>“My uncle wishes me to offer you a position in
my establishment, Mr. Vane. If that will meet your
views, I shall be happy to receive you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“I should like nothing better, sir,” replied Harry,
his eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“Will fifteen dollars a week satisfy you to begin
with.”</p>

<p>“But, sir, I can’t hope to earn as much as that.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps not just at first,” said the merchant,
smiling; “but if your looks don’t belie you, it will
not be long before your services will be worth that
sum. At any rate I am ready to pay it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Harry gratefully. “When
would you wish me to commence?”</p>

<p>“When you please. You had better take a vacation
of a month to visit your friends. Then come to
the city, and enter my employment.”</p>

<p>Harry renewed his thanks, and Mr. Woolson
turned to Jack.</p>

<p>“You have been trained as a sailor, I believe,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish to follow the sea?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Jack promptly. “I love the
sea.”</p>

<p>“Then I will find you a good position on one of
my ships, commend you specially to the captain as a
young friend of mine, and promote you as fast as your
progress in seamanship will warrant my doing so.”</p>

<p>Now it was Jack’s turn to look jubilant, for nothing
could have suited him better.</p>

<p>“You too will want a vacation. Take as long as
you like, and then come to me. By the way, I don’t
know how you are situated as regards money. If
either of you desires an advance, I shall be glad to
accommodate you.”</p>

<p>“We met with good luck at the mines,” said Harry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
“and are both well supplied with money. We thank
you, however, for your kind offer.”</p>

<p>The boys left the office in high spirits.</p>

<p>“I don’t see but our prospects are bright, Jack,”
said Harry.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think so when we were on the island,”
said Jack, “or when we were captives among the
bushrangers.”</p>

<p>“No; we have certainly seen some hard times.
Let us hope that we have had our share, and may
look forward now to happier days.”</p>

<p>Now that their future was arranged, the boys were
in a hurry to leave the city and visit their friends.
Obed sympathised with them.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said he, “I’m gettin’ kinder homesick.
There’s an old man and a girl I want to see, and tell
’em of my good luck.”</p>

<p>“Your father and——”</p>

<p>“Suke Stanwood. Suke has been waitin’ for me
five years, and there ain’t no need of waitin’ any
longer. If all goes well she’ll be Mrs. Obed Stackpole
within a month.”</p>

<p>“She may not be able to get her wedding things so
soon, Obed.”</p>

<p>“She don’t need any wedding things. Any dress’ll
do to be married in.”</p>

<p>“You will send us some cards and cake, I hope,
Obed.”</p>

<p>“Better’n that: I’ll send you an invite to the
weddin’.”</p>

<p>“Then it’ll have to come soon, Obed. I shall be
gone to the city, and Jack to sea within a
month.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll hurry it up. It’ll give me a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
excuse. But there’s one thing I’m going to do before
I get married.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Pay off the mortgage on dad’s farm. It’s only a
thousand dollars, but dad couldn’t lift it if he lived
to a hundred.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do, Obed?”</p>

<p>“There’s a farm alongside I can buy for twenty-five
hundred dollars, with a comfortable house thrown
in. I can buy it, and have more than enough money
left to furnish the house and stock the farm.”</p>

<p>“I wish you happiness, Obed; but don’t you think
you’ll ever pine to be back in Australia?”</p>

<p>“I may hanker after a sight of Fletcher and his
two cronies, Colson and Ropes,” returned Obed with
dry humour, “but we can’t have everything in this
world, and I’ll try to rub along with the blessings I
have.”</p>

<p>Let me add here that Obed carried out his programme.
He paid the mortgage, bought the farm,
and in less than three weeks he was a married man.
Harry and Jack were at the wedding, and received
great attention from all Obed’s friends. To the inhabitants
of the little village it seemed wonderful
that boys so young should have travelled so far, and
passed through such varied experiences.</p>

<p>“I expect an invite to each of your weddings, boys,”
said Obed, as they were on the point of leaving him.
“One good turn deserves another.”</p>

<p>“You will have to exercise a little patience, Obed,”
said Harry, smiling.</p>

<p>“Don’t wait as long as I did,” said Obed. “I got
to be a cranky old bachelor before I hitched horses.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Stackpole will soon cure you of that,” said
Harry, with a smile.</p>

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap2">W</span>HEN Harry had completed his business in
New York, he took the train at once to his
native village. His arrival made quite
a sensation. Not only Mr. Howard, his
father’s friend, received him with joy,
but there were many other friends besides who rejoiced
in his good fortune.</p>

<p>“You have been very fortunate, Harry,” said Mr.
Howard. “You tell me that you have about five
thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and it makes me feel rich.”</p>

<p>“Besides the two thousand dollars I have in charge
for you.”</p>

<p>“Two thousand dollars!” ejaculated Harry in amazement.
“You mean three hundred, Mr. Howard.”</p>

<p>“No, I mean what I say,” replied his friend, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember the fifty shares of mining
stock you placed in my hands?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they were given me by my father. I thought
them worthless.”</p>

<p>“A month ago I learned the contrary. I took the
liberty, without consulting you, as you were absent,
to sell them. They realised seventeen hundred
dollars net, thus carrying up the amount in my hands
to two thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that I am worth seven thousand
dollars? It seems wonderful!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“But the best of it is that it is true. Then was
there not a sum of money which you received for
saving a railroad train?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have used part of it, but one hundred and
fifty dollars remain. It is in the hands of a Mr.
Conway, president of the road.”</p>

<p>“Then it appears to me, Harry, taken in connection
with your offer of employment in New York, you are
in a very enviable position. How old are you?”</p>

<p>“I shall soon be seventeen.”</p>

<p>“Then you are beginning the world young. Continue
to deserve good fortune, and you are likely to prosper.”</p>

<p>Before returning to New York Harry felt inclined
to visit his would-be guardian, John Fox, whose
treatment of him has been recorded at length in
“Facing the World.”</p>

<p>He took the train, as before, to Bolton, and thence
went by stage to Colebrook. He walked to the Fox
mansion, and going up to the front door knocked.</p>

<p>The door was opened by Mrs. Fox herself. She
did not immediately recognise Harry in his handsome
suit, with a gold chain crossing his vest, attached, it
may be added, to a handsome gold watch, which he
had bought in New York.</p>

<p>“What is your business, young man?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember me, Mrs. Fox?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Land’s sake! It ain’t Harry Vane!” she exclaimed
in wonder.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” answered Harry, smiling. “I hope
Mr. Fox and Joel are well.”</p>

<p>“Come in, and I’ll call Joel. You’ve been doing well,
ain’t you?” she asked, surveying him with eager
curiosity.</p>

<p>“I have been very fortunate indeed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“I thought you was drowned—wrecked on a ship
or something.”</p>

<p>“If I was, I have come to life again.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, it’s strange. I’ll call Joel.”</p>

<p>Joel, who was at the barn, soon entered. He, too,
surveyed Harry curiously.</p>

<p>“How d’y’do?” he said. “I never expected to set
eyes on you again. Is that a gold watch you have?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Joel.”</p>

<p>“Let me see it. How much did it cost?”</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars, besides the chain.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! Ain’t that a sight of money! Did you
spend all your money on it?”</p>

<p>“No, I bought a chain too.”</p>

<p>“To my mind you was very foolish to spend all
your hard earnin’s that way! There’s no fool like a
young fool,” said Mrs. Fox severely.</p>

<p>“But, Mrs. Fox, I have some money left.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Joel eagerly.</p>

<p>“Seven thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Gosh all Jerusalem! you ain’t yarnin’, be you?
Seven thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“Who’s talkin’ of seven thousand dollars?” asked
a familiar voice, as Mr. Fox entered the room.</p>

<p>“Harry Vane says he’s worth seven thousand
dollars!” exclaimed Joel, in a tone made up of amazement,
jealousy, and wonder.</p>

<p>“Is that true?” asked John Fox, in equal amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Fox.”</p>

<p>“But how on ’arth——”</p>

<p>Then Harry gave a full explanation, with which I
don’t propose to trouble the reader, as it would be a
twice-told tale.</p>

<p>“Some folks seem born to luck!” said Mr. Fox
furiously, when Harry had completed his story.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
“Joel may work and toil all his life, and he won’t get
no seven thousand dollars. It seems hard!”</p>

<p>John Fox had been much impressed by Harry’s
luck, and his avaricious soul was busying itself with
some scheme for turning it to his personal advantage.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve been so lucky, Harry,” he said,
with affected cordiality. “It beats all, I must say.
I’ve no doubt you are ready now to carry out your
dear father’s dyin’ wish.”</p>

<p>“What was that, Mr. Fox?”</p>

<p>“He wanted me to be your guardeen. It stands
to reason a boy of sixteen ain’t to be trusted with
so much money. Now I’m an experienced man of
business, and I’m willin’ to be your guardeen, and I
won’t charge you a cent for takin’ care of your property
except board money.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Fox,” said Harry, with an amused
smile, “but I am offered a place in New York at
fifteen dollars a week, and I have friends who will
advise me about the investment of my money.”</p>

<p>“Fifteen dollars a week!” repeated Mr. Fox dolefully.
“Can’t you get a place for Joel in the same store?”</p>

<p>“If I can find Joel a satisfactory place in the city I
will do so,” said Harry, “but I ought to say that my
employer only pays me high wages out of favour.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take ten,” said Joel eagerly. “You know you
and me was always friends, Harry.”</p>

<p>“Joel always liked you,” said politic Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>Harry knew better, but he was on good terms with
the world, and he did not dispute this statement.</p>

<p>“I’ll do what I can,” he said. “Meanwhile, Mr. Fox,
I should like to make Joel and his sister a small
present.”</p>

<p>He gave them each a ten-dollar bill, which made
Joel’s eyes sparkle with joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Mr. Fox renewed his suggestion that Harry select
him as a “guardeen,” but Harry politely but firmly
declined to entertain the proposal. Nevertheless, when
he left the house, he was warmly urged to come again
and often. He understood the reason of the cordiality,
and knew very well that if he had come back
poor his reception would have been very different.</p>

<p>Before going back to New York he made a visit
of a couple of days to his old friend and employer,
Professor Hemmenway, the prestidigitateur, who was
delighted with the success of his young friend. He
offered Harry a new engagement, but of course it
was declined.</p>

<p>In New York he met Jack, and inquired how he
had fared.</p>

<p>“I found my stepfather dying,” answered Jack.
“In fact he drank himself to death after wasting all
mother’s property. But I have bought her a small
house, and insured her an income sufficient to keep
her comfortable. The last will require some of my
principal, but I shall be earning good wages, and can
make it up when I return home.”</p>

<p>“When do you sail, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Next week, on one of Mr. Woolson’s ships. I am
to go to China.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll steer clear of the island we were
wrecked on, Jack.”</p>

<p>“I never want to see it again, Harry; still it brought
us luck.”</p>

<p>“I shall be sorry to part with you, Jack. I wish
you could be content to stay in New York.”</p>

<p>“No, Harry, I can’t give up the sea yet. It is my
great ambition to command a ship myself some time.”</p>

<p>“I think you will accomplish it, Jack, for you stand
well with the owners.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>Five years have passed. Harry and Jack are each
twenty-one. Harry occupies a confidential position
with the firm, and is likely to be a partner before he
is much older. Jack is first mate, and will be a captain
before he is twenty-five. His mother is living, and
happy in his success, and enjoying the comfortable
home he has provided for her.</p>

<p>Harry obtained a position for Joel in the city, but
he proved unsatisfactory to his employer and was
soon discharged. Another situation he held as brief
a time. At last he was obliged to go home and assist
his father, who treats him almost as penuriously as
he would have done Harry. Joel is dissatisfied and
unhappy, and his mother thinks he was born to bad
luck, but those who know Joel think his want of
success springs from a different source. Harry and
Jack obtained success because they deserved it. If
Joel were more like them he too might succeed. And
I am sorry to say he is looking forward impatiently
to the time when he shall inherit his father’s property.
It is very wrong, but perhaps Mr. Fox himself
is partly to blame.</p>

<p>Whenever Jack comes home from a voyage he
calls upon Harry, and together they talk over their
adventures in a new world. Sometimes Obed Stackpole
calls also. He has two boys, whom he has named
respectively Harry and Jack in honour of his two companions
in Australia.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
